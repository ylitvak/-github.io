Now I want to talk about two more ideas. Re- call when I had the centers [Ashok ate] a frog, I said lets focus on the verb formula. That was in- deed correct, but one can have frames for nouns as well. So one could have a frame for Angela, or for lasagna, or for Olive Garden, or for night. If one had a frame for Angela and lasagna, and so on, in that case, one could, instead of saying Angela here, point to a frame for Angela. Here is an illustration that shows you that. We may have then information about Angela, quite apart from the sentence about Angela having lasagna with her dad. And that information might be pulled together, with this frame for ate to the pointer. So that now this frame for ate is connected with this frame for Angela. Similarly we may have some information for the restaurant of Olive Garden. We may know for example, that the Olive Garden is located in Atlanta, or that it has a particular price range. So, two ideas. First, not only frames for words, but also for nouns, and second frames can get connected with each other, so that the filler of a slot in one frame, can point to another frame. So Ashok it sounds like this kind of representation can be used to make even more advanced inferences. So if I have a frame for Angela, my frame for Angela might have a slot that says food preferences. And under that food preference slot, the filler might be Italian food. And then, when I see this representation, based on that slot and that filler, I can then infer that she’s not only happy, she’s very happy because she had one of her favorite foods. That’s a good point, David. So far we have been talking about sentence level understanding. The sentence that Angela ate lasagna at Olive Garden with her dad, for example. But we can also talk about this cost level understanding, or this cost may contain a series of sentences, one after the other. So the first sentence, for instance, may say something about Angela and her food preferences. And we may construct a frame for Angela. The second sentence may say something about, a restaurant called Olive Garden, which is located in Atlanta. And we may construct a frame for the Olive Garden. When the third sentence comes, and says that Angela had lasagna with her dad at Olive Garden, we construct a frame, and then we can hook up these various frames. And now we beginning to get a disclosed level understanding. Not just a sentence level understanding. So indeed, just like a frame enables us to understand some unit of language. For example, a sentence or a phrase. When we start hooking up these frames together, we can start understanding larger units of language, for ex- ample, a group of sentences of discourse. As we go along, we will see these frames also allow us to pull information from the input sentences, to put in the [Ashok ate] of this slot. So indeed, the ability to hook these frames together, allows for a lot of complex inferences and they will be a major part of common sense reasoning, as we continue with this course.
