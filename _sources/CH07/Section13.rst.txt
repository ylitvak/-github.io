David, were you able to write down the slots and the fillers. I was. So, for object x, I have that it’s a large triangle, that is not filled in. For object y, I have it’s a large circle that’s not filled in. And for object z, I have that it’s a small circle, that is filled in. As far as the relationships go, in this case we have that z is inside y. Z is inside y. Z is above x, which it is, and y is also above x. Y is above x. Good David, that sounds right to me.
