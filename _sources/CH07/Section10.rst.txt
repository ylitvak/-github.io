That’s good, David. But here’s something interesting to note. It could have been that this was the input sentence and that this frame representation got constructed from this input sentence. So Haruto became the subject and the person and ate became the verb and so on. Alternately, this could have been the frame representation and perhaps the sentence which error gets through language generation from this frame representation. So the frame representation could potentially act as an intermediate representation for both sentence comprehension and for sentence generation. Of course, there’s a lot more to sentence generation and to sentence comprehension than what we have shown so far.
