For this assignment, discuss how you’d use frames to represent Raven’s Progressive Matrices. At a basic level, what are the slots and fillers associated with different Raven’s problems? Where are these frames going to come from? Is the agent going to receive the problem in terms of frames initially, or it going to generate these frames based on its own reasoning? Once it has these frames, what exactly are the reasoning methods it’s going to use to solve the problem based on these frames? We’ve also talked about frames representing individual figures from the problem. But what about a frame represent- ing the problem, as a whole? What about a frame representing individual shapes within figures? How would representing the problems at that different level of abstraction, help the agents solve the problem more easily. What are frames going to enable us to do, that we couldn’t do otherwise?
