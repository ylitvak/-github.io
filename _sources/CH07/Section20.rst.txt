Section 20: Summary

Frames represent stereotypes of a certain concept (e.g. situation, event, etc.) and are composed of Slots and Fillers. Frames provide default values for the Slots and can inherit from one another. Frames are representationally equivalent to Semantic Nets. In other words, a frame can capture a large amount of information in an organized manner as a packet. Frames enable us to construct a theory of cognitive processing which is both bottom-up and top-down. The data in the frames generates expectations of the world in a cognitive-efficient manner.
