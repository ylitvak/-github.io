Today we’ll talk about frames. Frames are a very powerful and very common knowledge representation. Frames are our first step, a basic unit towards building a creative common sense reasoning. They’ll also come up in several other topics, such as understanding. We’ll begin by talking about the function of frames, what are they useful for, and what makes them so useful. Then we’ll talk about several properties of frames. We’ll relate the knowledge representation of frames with other knowledge representations, such as semantic networks and production systems. And finally, we will show how frames can be very useful for sense-making. For story understanding.
