At the beginning of each lesson, we’ll briefly introduce a topic as shown in the graphics to the right. We’ll also talk about how the topic fits into the overall curriculum for the course. Today, we’ll be discussing AI in general, including some of the fundamental conundrums and characteristics of AI. We will describe four schools of AI, and dis- cuss how knowledge based AI fits into the rest of AI. Next, we’ll visit the subtitle of the course, Cognitive Systems, and define an architecture for them. Finally, we’ll look at the topics that we’ll cover in this course in detail.
