I hope our discussion of the big problems in AI didn’t scare you off, let’s bring the discussion down, closer to work. And talk about a few fundamental characteristics of AI problems. 
1. In many AI problems, data arrives incrementally not all the data comes right at the beginning. 
2. Problems often have a recurring pattern, the same kinds of problems occur again and again. 
3. Problems occur at many different levels of abstraction. 
4. Many interesting AI problems are computationally intractable. 
5. The world is dynamic, it’s constantly changing but knowledge of the world is relative to static. 
6. The world is open ended but knowledge of the world is relatively limited. 

So, the question then becomes, how can we design AI agents that can address AI problems with these characteristics. Those are the challenges we’ll discuss in this course.
