Let us do an exercise together. Once again, we have the four quadrants shown here, and at the top left are four compression artifacts. I'm sure you're familiar with all four of them. C- 3PO is a fictitious artifact from Star Wars. Can we put these four artifacts in the quadrants to which they best belong?
