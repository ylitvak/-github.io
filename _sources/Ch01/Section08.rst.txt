Let's start with looking at an example of an AI agent in action. Many are you are family with Watson, the IBM program that plays Jeopardy. Some of you may not be, and that's fine, we'll show an example in a minute. When you watch Watson in action, try to think. What are some of the things Watson must know about? What are some of the things that Watson must be able to reason about in order to play Jeopardy? Write them down. And anytime you feel the pain, hey, this guy refrain. Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. Watson? Who is, Jude? Yes. Olympic Oddities, for 200. Milorad Cavic almost upset this man's perfect 2008 Olympics, losing to him by one-hundredth of a second. Watson. Who is Michael Phelps. Yes, go. Name the decade for 200. Disneyland opens and the peace symbol is create. Ken. What are the 50s? Yes. Final Frontiers for 1,000, Alex.
