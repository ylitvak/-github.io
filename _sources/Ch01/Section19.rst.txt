So at the end of every lesson, I will brie y recap what we talked about during that lesson and try to tie it into some future topics. To- day, we started o by talking about the central conundrums and characteristics of AI. This may have connected with some of your previous experience with other AI classes, like ma- chine learning in AI for robotics. We then talked about the four schools of AI, and we talked about knowledge-based AI more specifically, what is it and where does it t in with the other schools? Then we talked about cognitive systems and how cognitive systems are always concerned with human like intelligence. Lastly, we talked about the overall structure of the course, which is bro- ken up into eight large categories, like learning, planning and analogical reasoning. Next time we'll talk a little bit more specifically about this class in particular. The goals, the outcomes and the learning strategies, and what projects you'll complete.
