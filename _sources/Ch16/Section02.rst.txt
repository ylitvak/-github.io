|Exercise A Simple Conversation| 
To motivate our discussion of scripts, let us continue with our metaphor
of machines with whom we can talk in stories. Now the Watson program and
the Siri program, normally they understand stories that are limited to
one sentence. You can ask Watson a question, you can ask Siri a
question, and those questions are one sentence questions. Similarly when
Siri and Watson reply, they typically give their answers in one word or
one sentence at most. The story plays a very important role in the life
of quadrant division and we would expect AI agents that live among
quadrant divisions also to be able to understand stories. And one of the
common roles that story players that they enable more common sense
reasoning. To see how stories enable common sense reasoning, consider
two simple sentences. Imagine the first sentence was, Ali asked, do you
think weâ€™ll have many customers in the next half hour? And the second
sentence is, Sarah replied, go ahead and grab your lunch. So these are
two sentences of a story. Does this story make sense to you?
