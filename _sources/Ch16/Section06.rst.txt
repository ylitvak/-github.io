|Definition of Scripts| 
So what is a script? A script is a knowledge representation for
capturing causally coherent set of events. Casually means that one event
sets off another. So when David goes to the coffee house, as soon as he
approaches the counter, the barista comes to him and says, what do you
want? One event has set off the next one. Coherent means the links
between these events make sense in the context of the world around us.
So in David’s script again, ordering coffee doesn’t cause the barista to
slap in the face. Because that would not be causally coherent in the
context of the world. These events are referent to events in the world.
Some events, like deciding or concluding, might be in the actor’s mind,
but for the most part these events are observable events.
