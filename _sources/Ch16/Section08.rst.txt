So here is a representation of the restaurant script. Here is the name
of the script, restaurant, and the six elements that we talked about
earlier. Track, props, roles, entry, result and scenes. So this
particular track refers to formal dining. Here are the props, tables,
menu, check, money, food and place. And for food and place we can use
symbols. These symbols can be used as variables. So where I may
different kinds of foods and different kinds of places in a restaurant.
Here are the rules, so S is a customer, W is a waiter, C is a cook, M is
a cashier, O is an owner and so on. The entry conditions are S is
hungry, S as the member is a customer, S has money and those conditions
are that S has less money. S is not hungry. S is pleased. But O has more
money. And scenes, well, let’s discuss them in the next slide. Here is a
representation of scene one. We’ll call it the entering scene. This
particular scene consists of several events. So in the first frame, the
customer S, S stands for the customer. Moves himself or herself. So S is
moving himself or herself to some restaurant, some place P. And the
second frame, the agent S, the customer Sees some table. So this frame,
the customer S decides to, take an action. The particular action is,
where this agent S this customer S moves. Customer S himself or herself
to the table. So this is a walking action going on. Let us continue
another set just a little bit longer. So now S is moving his own body
into a sitting position. Here, the waiter sees the customer, and now the
waiter moves himself to the customer. And now the waiter moves the menu,
to the customer. And this completes a representation of the first scene
of entering in a restaurant. One can imagine many more scenes. The next
scene might be a way to customer orders food. The third thing might be
the way the waiter brings food, and so on and so forth. And then the
last thing is the customer pays the bill and then walks out. This is a
stereotypical notion of a script. Your notion of a script, might be
slightly different depending on what kinds of restaurants that you go
to. In different cultures, the script for going to a restaurant might be
quite different. The point here is that the script is capturing in a
knowledge representation, what is known about the stereotypical
situation of going to a restaurant of a particular kind.
