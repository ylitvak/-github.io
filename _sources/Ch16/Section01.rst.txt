  *Better the rudest work that tells a story or records a fact, than the richest without meaning.

Today, we’ll talk about another knowledge representation called scripts.
Scripts allow us to make sense of discourses and stories and scenes.
Scripts are the culmination of of frames and understanding and common
sense reasoning these last few lessons. We’ll take what we learned about
frames and understanding and common sense reasoning to build superior
scripts. We’ll start by defining scripts, then we’ll talk about the form
and the content of scripts. Then we’ll discuss how we can use scripts to
generate expectations about discourses and stories that help us make
sense of the world around us. Finally, we’ll talk about the hierarchical
nature of scripts. I think you’ll enjoy this lesson.
