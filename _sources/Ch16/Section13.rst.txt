|Exercise Learning a Script 1| 
Which ones did you think, David, and why? So for learning a script, I
said that five of the things we’ve talked about so far would really help
an agent learn a script. So we’ve seen in the past that semantic
networks and frames are representationally equivalent. We saw that when
we put the raven’s progressive matrices problems in terms of first
semantic networks and then converted them to frames. Frames, as we’ve
seen, are very useful for storing the type of information necessary to
construct a thorough script. And if semantic networks are
representationally equivalent, then we can also imagine a script
composed of semantic networks instead. To skip the middle couple for a
second, I can imagine incremental concept learning to be very important
to learning scripts. We can an imagine an AI agent acting in the world
and encountering multiple events everyday, and even to start to kind of
develop a categorization scheme for those different experiences. So for
example, that agent might learn that if I’m developing a script for fast
food, whether or not I see a McDonald’s logo or a Wendy’s logo when I
walk in, is not necessarily important to which script I run. But whether
or not I see a counter with cashiers behind it or a hostess waiting to
see me, is important. So that way, an agent can use incremental concept
learning to learn the difference, for example, a fast food script and a
fine dining script. So Ashok discussed before, planning happens when an
agent has an initial state and a goal state and figures out how to
navigate between the two. Once they figured out that plan for navigating
between that initial state and that goal state, that then becomes a
script that could be transferred to a new similar situation without
having to completely re-plan the route from scratch. And finally common
sense reasoning helps the agent out because it gives the agent a kind of
a language within which to learn the script in the first place. It can
learn a script within this language of primitive actions that it
understands and then can use those to make sense of new and novel
situations. Production systems and learning by recording cases don’t
really apply as much to scripts because they both involve
representations at a very different level of abstraction, at a very low
level of abstraction. With learning by recording cases, we tend to stick
with the cases, whereas scripts we have an abstraction over them. And
production systems are more like atoms of knowledge representation
instead of molecules or compounds like we deal with with scripts. That’s
good, David. I may add, one of the things regarding the semantic
networks. Recall that when we discussed semantic networks, we had
considered how we could use semantic networks to interpret stories.
We’ll use this same example. Ashok wanted to become rich. He got a gun.
And we said that inside a semantic network the notes that correspond to
Ashok wanted rich and gun get activated. And the activation spread from
there and there’s a path that formed a spare semantic network that path
is the interpretation of this particular story. In a sense a script is
that part. Of course if you think you see a connection between
production systems or learning by recording cases and scripts that I
haven’t seen. Or if you think the connection between the other topics
and scripts isn’t quite as close as I’ve described, feel free to head
over to our forums and we’ll discuss it there.
