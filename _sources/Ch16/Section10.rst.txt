|Using a Script to Generate Expectations| 
With effort to expectation generation just a while back let’s look into
it more deeply. So when we actually interact with the world sometimes
things do not happen the way we expect them to happen. And sometimes
things happen that people are not expecting. But how do we know what to
expect and what not to expect? So consider a situation like this. This
is an instance of a script. In this particular case, I have gone to
Olive Garden. And the waiter is Andrew. So I move to a table and I sit
down at the table. And now Andrew sees me. So from my perspective, I am
expecting Andrew to come to me and give me a menu. But supposing this
never happens. I am sitting there waiting for Andrew, or someone else,
to come, and no one comes. That’s an expectation violation. So I know
something has gone awry. The reason I know that is because I continued
expectations using the scripts, expectations that are never fulfilled.
Now consider an alternate situation. Instead of Andrew coming to my
table and giving me a menu, Andrew comes to me and gives me a bill right
away. Well I should think that I would be surprised by that. That was an
unexpected event that occurred. Well several questions arise here.
First, could this be the beginning of theory of surprise? In both cases,
we were surprised. In one case where Andrew did not come and give a
menu. In the second case, when Andrew came and gave a bill instead of
giving the menu. On second notice, a surprise, it has two sides to it.
One, when things do not happen the way we expect them to happen. And the
other, when things happen the way in which we were not expecting them to
happen. This example shows, that scripts not only tell us what to make
sense of the world around us, they also tell us what to expect and what
not to expect. And that’s a powerful idea. So it seems like another
example where this happens really strongly, that we encounter fairly
frequently, is if you’ve ever seen a horror movie. One thing that horror
movies really do really, really well is they lure you into expecting one
thing to happen only to throw something completely different at you. So
they lure you into kind of a false sense of security in expecting that
nothing bad is going to happen in a particular scene, and then suddenly
they throw a ghost at you from offscreen and it kind of startles you.
And the reason it startles you is because it violates your expectations
for what were going to happen next. David, that’s a good point, that it
happens in many different kinds of movies. So when I go and see a
science fiction movie, or even a romance movie, I’m expecting certain
things to happen. And sometimes I think a movie is really good if it is
new and novel and different and it offers some surprising things. Notice
that this could also be the beginning of a theory of creativity. In the
last lesson we were talking about balance and humor. No we’re talking
about surprises. Some current theories of creativity say that a
situation is creative if it is A, novel, B, if it is useful or valuable
in some way, and C, if it is unexpected or surprising. Now, this begins
to capture at least one of those three dimensions of unexpectedness or
surprise, and that’s an important part. We’ll return to computational
creativity at the end of this course, when we’ll talk a lot more about
these issues.
