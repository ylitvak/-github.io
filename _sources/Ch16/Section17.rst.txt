|Wrap Up| 
So today we’ve talked about scripts, a complex way of understanding
stories in the natural world. Stories aren’t just narratives, though.
Painting, songs, buildings are all stories of different kinds. Stories
are around us every single day. We started off by defining scripts.
Scripts are causally coherent series of events. They give a prototype
for what to expect in certain situations. The form of the general script
shows us the form of the overall prototype for the situation. A specific
instantiation of the script then specifies the content. Scripts can have
different tracks as well. At a high level, any kind of restaurant
involves entering, ordering, paying, and leaving. More narrowly though,
fast food and drive through restaurants involve different scripts from
casual or formal dining. This concludes our unit on common sense
reasoning, but note that some of what we cover in the future will be
applicable to learning, differentiating, and refining scripts.
