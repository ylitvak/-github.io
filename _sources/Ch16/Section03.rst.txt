|Exercise A Simple Conversation 1| 
What do you think, David, does it make sense to you? So, to me this
story does make sense. I can imagine it as a story where Ali and Sarah
are co-workers and Sarah has some kind of authority over Ali. Ali is
looking around the store and saying that there aren’t that many
customers right now, so maybe now is a good time take my lunch. But if
there’s about to be a rush of customers, then now is not a good time
because leaves Sarah there by herself. So Ali asks Sarah, do you think
there are going to be many customers in the next half-hour? Sarah knows
that it’s around lunch time and Sarah recalls maybe that Ali had
commented about missing breakfast this morning. So, she can infer Ali’s
motivation behind asking if there’s going to be many customers, and she
says, kind of anticipates the question he really was asking and says,
yeah go ahead and take your lunch. So, yeah, I can find a way for this
story to make sense, even though it doesn’t seem like a clear connection
between the two sentences. That’s good David. Clearly you have an active
imagination. Notice how David introduced lots of inferences here which
were not really part of the input. How did he do it? This is common
sense reasoning. How did he infer that it’s probably lunchtime and that
Ali wants to have lunch or that Sarah has some kind of authority over
Ali? We have come across stories like this earlier. Here is another
example. Ashok wanted to become rich, he got a gun. Two sentences and
you can, I’m sure, understand immediately what might be going on. You
may surmise that Ashok, as a professor, is unlikely to become rich, even
if he teaches this online Master’s course. On the other hand, you may
have some stereotypical story about how some people become rich. Well,
there are banks, and robbing a bank may require guns. And so now you can
relate Ashok getting a gun to trying to become rich. So you and I, as
human beings, have little difficulty in understanding stories like this.
You might be given two sentences like this and we can connect them,
causally connect them, coherently connect them, even if sometimes we use
very active imaginations to do so. How can we do this conjoining of
sentences into a coherent story? Put another way, how can we make AI
agent do it? What kind of knowledge should the AI agent have and what
kind of inferences must it make in order to be able to connect these two
sentences?
