So so far we have talked about a journal script of going to a
restaurant, or an abstract script for going to a restaurant. This is
like a class. We can instantiate it. So let’s do this same script
instantiated with these values with the greatest variables. So, Salwa is
not a customer. Lucas is the waiter. And so on. And this instantiation
is an important aspect of intelligence. Let’s go back to our intelligent
agent. It might be that Salwa is really a robot. Now, how would a robot
know what to do in a restaurant? How do we program a robot in such a way
that it would know what actions to take in a particular situation? Well,
suppose that, Salwa the robot, in its memory, had a number of scripts
like this one? And when it entered a restaurant, it invoked the
restaurant script, which told it exactly what kind of actions to take.
We could also see how this script allows Salwa, the robot, to generate
expectations, to guess what will happen even before it happens. There is
one more thing worth noting here. Notice how we are composing scripts of
these primitive actions here, the same primitive actions that occurred
in the last lesson. So, these primitive actions are now providing the
fundamental units of frames that compose together in some causally
coherent sequence, make a script. This brings up another point. Notice
how some knowledge structures are composed out of other knowledge
structures. Earlier, we had frames for these primitive actions, gave
them social knowledge structures. Now, we have scripts which are
composed out of these framelike knowledge structures.
