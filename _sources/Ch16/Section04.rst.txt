|Story Understanding for AI Agents| 
That’s a good story David. Now let’s consider a different set of issues.
Imagine that I told you a story. Bob went to a restaurant and sat down.
But nobody came to serve him for quite awhile. Eventually, when someone
did appear, he ordered a hamburger. The hamburger took a long time
before it came. And when it did come, it was burned. Bob was not very
happy. He didn’t even finish the hamburger. Do you think Bob left a
large tip? Well, I expect most of you would say no. He did not leave a
large tip. If we had to wait for a long time. And if the food that came
eve, eventually, was not of very high quality. You’d probably not even
ask tip. But how did you come to that answer? Why did you expect, that
in this particular case, Bob will not leave a large tip? Again, this
connects to your notion of a story. It connects to your notion of a
story, of what happens in a restaurant. Why do people leave tips? When
do they leave them? To put it another way, stories help you make sense
of the world. They help you [generate] expectations, even before
[generate]. They allow us to make connections between evens that
otherwise might appear disparate. So in this lesson, we’ll look at
another structured knowledge representation called scripts. For
representing stories or the kind that we are talking about. And we will
see how this knowledge for presentation allows us to make sense of the
world. And answer the kinds of questions that we are talking about.
