|Exercise Using a Script 1| 
David, which of these topics do you think are applied to using a script?
So I chose four of the seven as applied to using a script. So for
problem reduction, we saw earlier that the script breaks down the
overall scene into smaller scenes, and even further into smaller
actions. What that means is that when we’re executing the script, and it
kind of gets caught somewhere we can break it down and see exactly where
the script got caught. So we can see exactly where an expectation was
violated. Classification we actually already discussed because
classification can help us identify which script to execute in a given
situation based on what we see. So if we walk into a restaurant and see
a hostess for example we can classify that as a specific kind of
restaurant and launch the script that goes along with it. Although it
would take a bigger jump, I can also imagine putting a script in terms
of formal logic. Especially because we discussed before, that a script
can be considered a plan that has already been executed once, and can be
transferred to new situations. So if we’re discussing plans in the form
of formal logic, we may also be able to put scripts in those same kind
of terms. In terms of what they’re asserting is true for a given state
of the script. So if we could put plans in the form of formal logic, we
can also imagine rewriting our script in the form of formal logic. That
would give us a script in terms of what different elements of the script
assert about the state of the world at different points of the script’s
execution. Finally, we can also see understanding applying pretty
directly to scripts because it helps us disambiguate similar events in
different situations. So to go with Ashok’s example about receiving the
bill right when you sit down at the table, understanding talks about how
we can disambiguate that event based on what else has happened before
and after. I didn’t see the other three as being as applicable to
scripts for a couple different reasons. For Generate & Test and
Means-Ends Analysis, these are problem solving methods. And as we talked
about with planning in the previous exercise, scripts are often used
when we already have a solution and we simply need to execute it.
Case-Based Reasoning keeps things at the level of individual cases that
can be adapted to our current problem. Where as scripts serve as an
abstraction over a number of cases. So I don’t really see case-based
reasoning applying as much here either. This is good, David. Thank you
for sharing this. Note that Generate and & Test, and Case-Based
Reasoning might be able to have the ability to use scripts after all. So
one can imagine a situation where there are a large number of scripts
available and the robot has to decide which of the scripts should I use
for a particular situation. And may not be able to classify the
situation dashed into scripts and with that case the robot will pick a
script, generate it, try it out, see if it works, if it does not pick
another one. Also Case-Based Reasoning is currently the application of
scripts in the sense that both Case-Based Reasoning and script-based
reasoning are extremely memory intensive. What both of them are saying
is that memory often supplies most of the answer. Like we said earlier
when we were discussing Case-Based Reasoning, we don’t think as much as
we think we do. Most of the time memory gives us the answer. The
difference, of course, like David pointed out is, that cases defer to
instances whereas scripts are abstractions of the instances.
