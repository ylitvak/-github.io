Scripts are strongly connected to current theories of human cognition.
In fact one recent theory says that brain is a predictable machine. We
do very quick bottom up processing followed by mostly top down
processing with general expectations of the world. Then we act on those
expectations. This idea in fact is so strong, that when it fails it
leads to amusement, or surprise, or anger. If I violate the expectations
of your script, you might find it funny or surprising or you might be
upset about it. An interesting and open question is, whether we carry
the scripts in our hear or do we generate them at run time? Scripts are
also current with the notion of mental models. You and I have mental
models, or scripts. Not just about social situations like going to a
restaurant, going to a movie, but also about how the computer program
works, how the economy works, how the car engine works, your physical,
social, economic works. Note that scripts can be culture specific. In
the U.S. for example, going to a restaurant typically involves leaving a
tip. But in many countries, this is not the case. In fact in some
countries, tipping is considered insulting. So scripts presumably
evolved through cultural interaction over long periods of time. But once
there, theyâ€™re a very powerful source of knowledge.
