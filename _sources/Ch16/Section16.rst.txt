|Assignment Scripts| 
So how would scripts help inform the design of an agent to solve Raven’s
progressive matrices? Remember, scripts are ways of making sense of
complex events in the world and we can certainly consider individual
Raven’s matrices to be complex situations. You thus might have a script
for different broad categories of Raven’s problems. If this was your
approach, what would your entry conditions be for each script? What
would the tracks be? What would the scenes be? Where are these scripts
going to come from? Are you going to tell the agent what script it
should use or will it learn a script from prior problems? If the agent
succeeds using the script that you give it, who is intelligent? You or
your agent?
