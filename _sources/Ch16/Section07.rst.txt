|Parts of a Script| 
So the structured knowledge for a presentation called script has six
parts to it. The first part is called entry conditions. These are the
conditions necessary to execute the script. So, for a restaurant script,
as an example, the entry condition might be that there is a customer who
is hungry and the customer has some money. The result refers to the
conditions that will become true, after the script has occurred, after
it has taken place. So, for restaurant script, the result might be that
the owner of some restaurant has more money, the customer has less
money, and the customer is now pleased and is no longer hungry. So the
third part of a script is our props. So the third part of script are
called props. Props are the kind of objects that are involved in the
execution of this script so in case of the restaurant script the props
might include tables and menus and food items and so on. So the fourth
part of a script is roles. These are the agents involved in the
execution of the script. As an example in the restaurant script it might
be a customer who goes to a restaurant, the owner of the restaurant, the
waiter or the waitresses in the restaurant, and so on. The fifth element
of a script is a track. Track are variations or subclasses of a
particular script. So for example in case of the restaurant script we
may have tracks for going to a coffee house, or going to a fast food
restaurant, or to a fine dining house. And finally the sixth element of
a script refers to scenes. Scenes are specific sequence of events that
occur during the execution of the script. So in case of the restaurant
script there might be a scene for entering a restaurant. And a scene for
ordering food. And a third scene for accepting the food and so on. When
you put all of the six elements together then you get a complete script.
In the previous lesson we had taken the metaphor of a molecule as a
knowledge representation. That is, knowledge representations that are
not small or short or not atomic, but are molecule in nature, script is
a big, large molecule.
