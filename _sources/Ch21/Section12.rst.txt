Configuration is also connected to classification. In case of classification, you establish and then define, establish and then define. In case of configuration, you're going to extension the plan, assign the values to the variables, refine and expand. Extension the plan, assign values to the variables, refine and expand. Second configuration leverages classification's notion of prototypical concepts. So the hierarchy of plans is organized around these prototypical notions of a components of a chair. A chair typically consists of legs, and seats, and arms, and back, and so on. The ranges of values that these variables can take are also part of a prototypical knowledge of various components of a chair. In fact they are part of the default value of this particular component. Clearly there are also differences between classification and configuration. We use classification to make sense of the world by mapping combinations of precepts into equivalence classes. We use configuration to act on the world by designing actions. >> So it sounds to me like while classification is a way of making sense of the world, configuration is a way of creating the world. With classification, we perceive certain details in the world and decide what they are. With configuration, we're given something to create and we decide on those individual variables.
