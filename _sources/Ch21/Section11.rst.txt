So David, how did you configure the chair? So you can see here my final configuration for this chair. I ended up with a 160 gram chair. It cost $16 based on having four metal legs. I didn't give it arms. I gave it a metal back. And of course the 100 gram metal seat that was required. As far as how I actually did this though, like before, I started off by writing out the initial constraints we were given. The chair has to cost less than $16. It has to have 100 g metal seat. And it has 100 g metal seat. And that seat has to cost $10. So 100 grams times $0.10 per gram means $10 for the seat. After this, however, we're already pretty close to our price limit. So the plan I'm using might specify that when we're getting within a certain range of our price limit to operate under a heuristic that calls for minimizing the cost. That heuristic in that plan might then say, find the part that can be minimized the most next. That part would be the arms. The arms had a range from 0 grams to 50 grams, meaning that arms are not even required in our chair. So to minimize our costs, we're going to go ahead and cut the arms, and say that our arms cost nothing. Now our plan might recognize that we're no longer quite as constrained by our price, so we're going to choose the next most important part of the chair, which might be the legs. Given some information that the plan has about the ideal legs, it might choose to have four legs, that are ten grams each and are made of metal, which gives us a cost of $4. Based on the $10 seat and the four dollar legs, we now know that we have $2 left for our back. The plan may have a heuristic that says it's ideal to match materials or the plan may have a heuristic that says that metal is the optimal material to use. So it may choose metal. And given $2 for the remaining money and a material of metal, it can derive that 20g is the mass available for the back. And now that all of these individual variables have been assigned, we can then see that the final mass is 160g, and has a cost of $16. At most $16 meets that constraint. And we have our 100g metal seat over here. >> That's good David. This important note that David used several different kinds of knowledge. First, he had knowledge of the general chair. He knew about the components, he knew about the slots, but not necessarily all the fillers for the slots. Second, he had heuristic knowledge, he used the term heuristic. Recall that heuristic stands for rule of thumb. So heuristic knowledge about how to go about filling the values of some of these slots. Third, explicit list is not just knowledge about legs and seats and arms and so on, but also how this chair, as a whole, is decomposed into its components. That is one of the fundamental rules of knowledge and knowledge-based AI. It allows us to structure the problem so the problem can be addressed efficiently. Note that this process of configuration design is closely related to the method of constrained proposition that we discussed in a previous lesson. Here are some constraints, and these constraints have been propagated downwards in the plan abstraction hierarchy.
