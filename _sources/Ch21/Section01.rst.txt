*The initial configuration of the universe may have been chosen by God, or it may itself have been determined by the laws of science. In either case, it would seem that everything in the universe would then be determined by evolution according to the laws of science, so it is difficult to see how we can be masters of our own fate.

Today, we'll talk about configuration. Configuration is a very routine kind of design task in which all the components of the design are already known. The task now is to assign values to the variables of those components so they can be arranged according to some constraints. Configuration will be your first part under the unit on designing creativity. We'll start by talking about design, then we'll define configuration. Then we trace through the process of configuration, a specific measure called planned refinement. Finally, we'll connect configuration to several earlier topics we have discussed such as classification, case based reasoning, and planning.
