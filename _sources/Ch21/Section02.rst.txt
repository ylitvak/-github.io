Let us talk about what is design. Design in journal takes us input some sort of needs, so goals or functions. It gives us output that's specification of this structure of some artifact that satisfies those needs and goals and functions. Note that the artifact need not be a physical product. It can be a process. A program, a policy. Some example for design, design a robot that can walk on water. Design a search engine that can return the most relevant answer to a query. The Federal Reserve Bank designs and monitor the policy to optimize the economy. Note the design is very wide ranging, open ended and ill-defined. In problem solving, typically the problem remains fixed, even as the solution evolves. In design, both the problem and the solution co-evolve. The problem evolves as the solution evolves. We are studying design and AI because we are working with AI agents that can do design. At least potentially, we want AI agents that can design other AI agents.
