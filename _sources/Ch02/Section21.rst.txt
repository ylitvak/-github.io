Now let us look at some three by three problems. This time the matrix has three rows and three columns. We are given not just A, B, and C. We are given A, B, C in the first row, D, E, F in the second row, G and H in the third row. We do not know what will go here under I. Again, we want horizontal, vertical, and diagonal relationships. A is to B is to C, as D is to E is to F, as G is to H is to what? And similarly vertically. As well as diagonally. If we take all three of those constraints, rows, columns and diagonals, which would be the correct choice among one through six to put under the square?
