Okay, here are some two by two problems. Two by two matrix problems. The situation is somewhat similar, but not exactly similar. Once again, we’re given A, B, C, and D is unknown, and we’re given six choices, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and we are to pick one of these choices and put it in D. What is different here however is that, this time it is not just that A is to B as C is to D but also A is to C as at B is to D. That’s why it’s a two by two matrix. So it’s not just the horizontal relationship that counts but it’s also the vertical relationship that counts.
