What do you think is the right answer David? So, looking horizontally every row except for the third row has a diamond. Vertically every column except the third column has a diamond. And diagonally the shapes are preserved if we imagine Câ€™d be coming down here, G coming up here. So it seems like all signs point to number one. That is indeed the correct answer. But, you said something very important about this particular problem. And that is that, we can imagine that these rows are rotating, so that this C gets aligned with D, and D gets aligned with H, as if they were on a diagonal. One more point about this. Once again David was able to solve this problem within a few seconds. What about an AI program? How could the AI program solve this problem? What representations would it use? What reason strategies would it use? Would it induce something from the first row? Would it learn something from the first row and apply it to the second row? If so, how would it do that induction?
