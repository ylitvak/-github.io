For this one, David, what do you think is the right answer? So I put that the right answer was number 5. Number 5 looks like it preserves the reflection that’s going on across the horizontal axis. That’s a good answer, David, but note that 2 is also a plausible answer. One can imagine that the image A is rotating by 90 degrees to the image B. And if we rotate the image in C by 90 degrees, we’ll get the answer 2. So both 5 and 2 here are plausible answers. Okay, and the question arises, which answers do most humans choose? Why do they choose the answer that they do choose? What in their cognition is telling them to choose one answer over the other? And then how can we write an AI program that can choose one answer over the other? An interesting thing to note about this problem as well is that I phrased this as reflections. Ashok, defined number 2 as rotations. But it’s possible that we could do this a third way. Instead of look- ing at rotations or reflections, which are kind of semantic ways of describing the transformations, we could look at which image completes the overall picture. Here, number 5 would seem to be the right answer, because it finishes creating the square we see forming. So that would be a strictly visual way of doing this problem as well. One more thing to note here. So far we have been talking about horizontal and vertical relationships and not diagonal relationships. So A is to B as C is to D, and A is to C as B is to D. What about diagonal relationships? Should A to D be as B to C? If we add that additional constraint, then the choice between 2 and 5 be- comes clear. 5 is the right choice because that’s the only way we’ll get A is to D as B is to C.
