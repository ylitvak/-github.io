Okay, David, are you ready for this one? What answer did you come up with? So after pondering it for far too long, I finally came to the answer that the answer is five. This problem is very different than the one that we’ve seen in the past, because it’s the relationship between the first two frames in each row and column that dictates the third frame. The relationship is called exclusive or. If the box appears in both the first two frames in a row or column, it doesn’t appear in the third one. If it appears in neither of the first two frames, it doesn’t appear in the third one, but if it appears in exactly one of the frames, it appears in the third one as well. So here the top right square appears in both A and B, so it doesn’t appear in C. The top left and bottom left squares appear in B only, so they do appear in C. If you look across the rows and down the columns, you’ll see that, that relation- ship holds true for every row and column. And in fact, both rows and columns give us five as the answer. So if the row, the bottom left and bottom right appear each in only one of those frames, while the top right appears in both. So bottom left and bottom right appear here. For the right column, top left and top left appear both times, while bottom left and bottom right each only appear once. So the answer here again is bottom left and bottom right. That was excel- lent. Five looks like the right answer. Now did you follow the same strategies this time that you had followed the last time? No, definitely not. In the earlier problem, we saw that the first row had relationships that carried through for every single row. It didn’t really matter what order the figures were in. All that mattered was the relationships between them. Here, if we were to switch around some of the figures it would change what the other figures would have to be. And change the nature of the relationship in- side each row and column. So we’ve used a fundamentally different kind of reasoning process. And that’s part of what makes this problem so difficult is that it’s unlike the ones we’ve seen in the past. That’s very interesting, couple of other things to note as well. I wonder whether this time you actually pick one, put it under here, and then solve with the completed pattern or not. And if they did not succeed, you pick the second one and put it here and solve the patterns succeeded or not and went through it systematically. And finally came up with five because that fit the pattern the best. If that were the case, then this would be a different strategy from looking at the first row and the second row and the first column and the second column, inducing some rule and applying it with the third row. One other thing to note, something very interesting about knowledge based AI. We can ask ourselves, how is David solving these problems, if we can figure out, if we can generate hypothesis about how David is solving these problems, then that will inform how we can build an AI agent that can solve these problems. There is a side where we’re going from human cognition to AI. Alternatively, we can write an AI program that can solve these problems and by looking at how we are programmed to solve these problems we can generate hypotheses about how David might be solving problems. That’s going from the AI side to the cognitive science side.
