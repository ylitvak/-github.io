Let us consider an example. We are shown initially three images, A, B and C. And you have to pick a candidate for the D image here on the top right. And it can be one of these six candidates that would go here in the D image. Given that A is to B, as C is to D, what would you pick among the six choices at the bottom to put into D?

.. mchoice:: questions1_1		
   :answer_a: C is to 1
   :answer_b: C is to 2
   :answer_c: C is to 3
   :answer_d: C is to 4
   :answer_e: C is to 5
   :answer_f: C is to 6
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! The outer shapes do not match, In A:B the shapes stay the same.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! The inner shapes do not match, In A:B the shapes stay the same.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! In A:B the outer shape did not disappeared.
   :feedback_e: Incorrect! In A:B the imaged changed, thus C can't be the same as D

   What would you pick among the six choices at the bottom to put into D?
