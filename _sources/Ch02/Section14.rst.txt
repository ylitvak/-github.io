Okay. What do you think is the right answer to this one David? So, what I said is that it looks like there’s a 180 degree rotation going on. So this frame is rotated 180 degrees to get this one. So I’m going to take C, rotate it 180 degrees to get number six. That’s a fair answer, David. Well done. But notice there is another possible answer here. Two is also a possible answer. Why is two a possible answer? Because one can imagine that B is really a reflection of A across a vertical axis, and that way if we think of a vertical axis on C, then two will be the reflection of C on the vertical axis. So both two and six are good answers here. And one question will then become, which one do humans pick, do they pick six or do they pick two? And second which one should an AI program pick? Six or two, and how would you make sure that the AI program picks two or six, and if you are thinking I am going to give you the answer, sorry to disappoint you. I’m going to leave this as a puzzle for you. Your AI program will address this problem.
