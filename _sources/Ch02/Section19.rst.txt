   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: D is to 1
   :answer_b: D is to 2
   :answer_c: D is to 3
   :answer_d: D is to 4
   :answer_e: D is to 5
   :answer_f: D is to 6
   :correct: c,e
   :feedback_a: Incorrect!
   :feedback_b: Correct! Interesting answer! While most people choose #5, there is definitely a case to be made for #2 as well. If we regard the vertical transformation as a rotation by -90째 and the horizontal rotation as a rotation by +90째, then #2 would be the right answer.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect!
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! 
   :feedback_e: Correct! However, there's a case that can be made for #2 as well. If we regard the vertical transformation as a rotation by -90째 and the horizontal rotation as a rotation by +90째, then #2 would be the right answer.
   :feedback_f: Incorrect!

   Given A, B, C, and D is unknown, Which choice represents D?
