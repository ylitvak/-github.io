What do you think is the right answer to this one, David? So this one reminded me of that third problem we did. The first thing I thought was that it looks like the entire figure is rotating. So I”m going to say that the figure will be this with the triangle pointing up and to the left, or up and to the right. However, looking over here, there are no answers that have the triangle rotated. So second thing I think is maybe just the outside figure is rotating. The square here rotated while the circle stayed stationary. So the circle here rotated, while the triangle stayed stationary. Because it’s a circle we can’t actually tell a visible difference between the two, but it seems to be the one that most preserves a relationship between A and B. Similarly, between A and C, the square on the outside becomes a circle on the outside. It’s the same thing here, the square on the outside becomes a circle on the outside. That’s a good answer David. Here is another point to note. Supposing we put one here in D, then C and D become identical, but A and B are not identical. Is that a problem here? Not really because we can imagine that the outer image in A is rotating to become B. And we can imagine that C in the outer image and C sort adding to become D. It just so happens that the resulting image is identical to the initial image. Note that this will be a challenge for an AI program. The AI program will have to generate solutions. It will have to evaluate solutions. Computationally programmed solutions that it self generates. What kind of knowledge representations would it allow it to generate good solutions? What reason strategies would allow it to generate plausible answers?
