Throughout this course, we will be using materials drawn from a number of different text- books and papers. You’ll find specific references to all these sources for this examples in the Class Notes. Generally, however, we will use a handful of books from which we will draw a lot of mate- rial. Artificial Intelligence by Patrick Winston. Knowledge Systems by Mark Stefik, Artificial Intelligence by Elaine Rich and Kevin Knight and Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. You don’t have to buy any of these books. But if you want to increase your knowledge beyond what we’ll dis- cuss in this class, you may want to consider both these text books and the specific references at the end of each lesson.
