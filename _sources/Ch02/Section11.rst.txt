Letâ€™s try an even harder problem. And as you solve this problem, think a little bit about how do you go about solving it.

.. mchoice:: questions3		
   :answer_a: C is to 1
   :answer_b: C is to 2
   :answer_c: C is to 3
   :answer_d: C is to 4
   :answer_e: C is to 5
   :answer_f: C is to 6
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! The transformation does not match A:B 
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! In A:B the outer circle did not disappeared.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! In A:B the inner shaped did not change shape
   :feedback_e: Incorrect! In A:B the inner shaped did not change shape and size
   :feedback_f: Incorrect! In A:B the outer shaped did not change shape

   Given that A is to B, what would we pick between 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to put into D?
