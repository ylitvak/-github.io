If you are designing a AI agent that can take an intelligence test. That raises the question, if we succeed is the AI intelligent. What do you think, David? So, I would say no, even if the agents that we design successfully solve the intelligence test, they aren’t themselves intelligent, they are just processing signals and inputs in the correct way. What do you think?

   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: Yes, Because Intelligence is more than just an algorithm for processing inputs.
   :answer_b: No, because that's the same way humans operate; we just don't know how humans think yet.
   :answer_c: Yes, but for another reason.
   :answer_d: No, but for another reason.
   :correct: a,b,c,d
   :feedback_a: There is no correct/incorrect answer.
   :feedback_b: There is no correct/incorrect answer.
   :feedback_c: There is no correct/incorrect answer.
   :feedback_d: There is no correct/incorrect answer.

   Is David right?


The problem with David’s answer, in my opinion is that at a certain level humans too are just processing signals and inputs in the right way. What then makes us intelligent? Intelligence is hard to define. In the life sciences, scientists study life, but don’t always agree on a definition of life. Similarly, in the cognitive sciences, we study intelligence, but don’t necessarily define it. And knowledge based AI, will take the view that knowledge is central to human level intelligence.
