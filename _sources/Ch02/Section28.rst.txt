Today we started off by discussing the goals, outcomes, and learning strategies for this class. That led us into discussing the project, the main assessment in this class. The project builds on Raven’s Progressive Matrices, an apocryphal human intelligence test, an idea called computational psychometrics, the application of computer models to understanding human cognition. We then discuss the seven main principles of CS7637 that are going to come up again and again in this course. We recommend you keep and eye out for them because they’ll come up in every single lesson. This is the end of the introduction to this course, so we hope you’re excited to get started. We’re going to start off with the fundamentals of knowledge based AI, including one of the most fundamental knowledge structures called semantic networks.
