*Perhaps the hardest truth to face, one that AI has been trying to wriggle out of for 34 years, is that there is probably no elegant, effortless way to obtain this immense knowledge base. Rather, the bulk of the effort must (at least initially) be manual entry of assertion after assertion. – Guha and Lenat: authors of the CYC knowledge base.*

In this lesson, we’ll talk most specifically about what you should expect from CS7637. We’ll start by talking about the learning goals, the learning outcomes, and the learning strategies that we’ll use for this class. Then we’ll dis- cuss the class projects and assessments. That will lead us to talking about something called Computational Psychometrics, which is one of the multi-weighting principles behind the projects in this class. Next we’ll talk about the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test of intelligence. I think you’re going to find it fascinating. The Raven’s Progressive Matrices test of intelligence are the most commonly used tests of human intelligence. And that test was the target of the projects in this class. Very ambitious, you’re going to enjoy it. Finally we’ll discuss something commonly reoccurring principle in this class and you should be on the lookout for them.
