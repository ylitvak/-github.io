Let us look at a connection between your class projects and human cognition. Beginning with psychometrics, psychometrics is the science of measuring human intelligence, aptitude, and knowledge. Computational psychometrics is the science of building agents that can take the same tests of intelligence that humans take. All the [computational] building AI agents that can address the Ravens test of intelligence, it will provide opportunities for thinking about human cognition. While we will be looking only for how well your agents perform on the Ravens test, in principle [computational] psycho-metrics will also look at the kinds of errors that AI agents make. If the errors the AI agents make are similar to those that humans make, then that may provide a source of hypothesis about human thinking on this Raven’s Test of Intelligence. It is also interesting to note that people with autism perform about as well on the Raven’s Test of Intelligence as neurotypical people. This is a little surprising, because in general, people with autism do not perform as well on other tests of intelligence as the neurotypical people. Note that Raven’s test of intelligence is the only test that consists only of visual analogy problems. All other tests of intelligence also include a large number of verbal problems. Might I suggest that some of the thinking strategies that people with autism are better aligned with visual reasoning.
