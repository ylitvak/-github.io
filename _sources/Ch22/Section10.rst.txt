|Exercise Diagnosis as Abduction 1| 

What answer did you give, David?\`\` So, my answer is that the best
explanation is a combination of Betatosis and Zetad. By combining these
two illnesses, we can cover all of the data we saw over here. We saw
both illnesses elevate B, which led to our High B, and both reduced C,
which led to our Low C. Our patient had a normal level of E, but the
effects of Betatosis and Zetad counteract their influence on E. Then
Zetad accounts for our Reduced F, and Betatosis accounts for our Reduced
H. My explanation, though, heavily weights the principle of coverage. I
sacrifice parsimony by having two different explanations for the sake of
coverage, I now cover all the symptoms. I could have also chose
Thetadesis. Thetadesis would have explained B, C, and H. It wouldn’t
explain F, but it would be a simpler explanation than the combination of
Betatosis and Zetad. In that case I would be sacrificing coverage for
parsimony. I could also augment Thetadesis with Kappacide and Mutension.
The three of them together would cover all our symptoms, but that would
also be less parsimonious than Betatosis and Zetad alone. I may have
chosen to do that though, if those three diseases were much more common
than Betatosis and Zetad. In which case, I would have more confidence in
them than just these two. It’s an excellent answer, David, but how did
you come up with this answer? So what I did, is I started with the data
and I looked at which of these hypotheses currently matched the data
best. That is to say, which hypotheses explained the most points and had
the fewest conflicts. So for example, Betatosis explained the High B,
the Low C, and the Low H, but it didn’t explain the Low F, and it also
suggested there was Elevated E. Initially, Thetadesis was the best
match, it explained three symptoms, it just didn’t explain the fourth.
Then, based on that, I went looking for another illness that would
complete the explanation. For Thetadesis, that ended up leading me to
Kappacide and Mutension, but at that point, I was using three different
hypotheses. So I decided to revisit one of the closer matches from my
original round. I revisited Betatosis, which had two mismatches, it
predicted Elevated E and didn’t explain the Reduced F. And I went
looking for another hypothesis that would complete that explanation.
Zetad happened to have exactly those two effects. Note that one can use
alternative methods for the same problem. For example, one could use
case-based reasoning, and for it, we came across a problem very similar
to this one previously. Suppose that the solution to that particular
problem was of a level as a case. In that particular case, B was high, C
was lower, F was low, and the solution was Thetadesis. In the current
problem, the additional symptom is that F is low. So case would force
you to the conclusion of Thetadesis. But it will create this particular
solution to also account for the additional symptom of F being low. We
could do that by adding Kappacide and Mutension to Thetadesis.
Case-based reasoning does, will tend to forecast the alternative set of
hypothesis. One more point to note here then, note that different
methods can lead to different solutions. Given different methods, how
might an error agent decide which method to select? We’ll return to this
particular problem when we discuss meta reasoning.
