We can think of diagnosis as a mapping from a data space, to a
hypothesis space, In case of a medical diagnosis, the data may be the
greatest kind of signs and symptoms that I may go to a doctor with. Some
of the data may be very specific, some of it may be very abstract, an
example of a very specific data is that a [another rule] temperature is
104 degrees fahrenheit. An example of the extraction of the data is that
[another rule] is running a fever. The hypothesis space consists of all
hypothesis that can explain parts of the observed data. A hypothesis in
the hypothesis space can explain some part of the data, In case of
medicine, this hypothesis may reference to diseases. A doctor may say
that my hypothesis is that a shook is suffering from flu, and that
explains his high fever. In the domain of car repairs, this hypothesis
may refer to specific faults with the car, for example, the carburetor
is not working properly. In the domain of computer software, this
hypothesis may refer to specific methods not working properly. And this
mapping from data space to the hypothesis space can be very complex. The
complexity arises partly because of the size of data space, partly
because of the size of hypothesis space, partly because the mapping can
be M to N. And also, because this hypothesis can interact with each
other, If H3 is present, H4 may be excluded, If H5 is present, H6 is
sure to be present and so on. It helps then not to deal with all the raw
data, but to deal with abstractions of the data, so the initial data
that a patient may go to a doctor with may be very, very specific. The
signs and symptoms of their particular specific patient, but the
diagnostic process might abstract them from Asok has a fever of 104
degrees farenheit to Asok has a high fever. This abstract data that can
be mapped into an abstract hypothesis, Asok has high fever can get
mapped into Asok has a bladder infection for example. The abstract
hypothesis can now be refined into a suffering from flu or a flu for a
particular screen. At the end, we want a hypothesis that is as refined
as possible, and that explains all the available data. When we were
talking about classification, we talked about two processes of
classification, bottom-up process and our top down process. The bottom
up process of classification, we started with raw data and then grouped
and abstracted, it in case of top down classification we started with
some high level class and then established it and refined it. You can
see that in diagnosis both the bottom up process of classification, and
the tope down process of classification are co-occurring. This method of
bottom up classification and data space, mapping and hypothesis space,
and then top down classification of hypothesis space is called heuristic
classification. This is yet another method like rule-based reasoning,
case-based reasoning, and model-based reasoning with a diagnostic task.
