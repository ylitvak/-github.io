Thank you very much.


Diagnosis is like configuration in the reverse. Diagnosis is the
identification of the fault(s) responsible for a malfunctioning system.
Diagnosis sets-up two spaces: Data space and Hypothesis space. Data
space contains data about the malfunctioning system. Hypothesis space
contains data about the fault that can explain the malfunctioning
system. Diagnosis is the construction of mappings from the data space to
the hypothesis space. Diagnosis has two views: diagnosis as
classification and diagnosis as abduction. Diagnosis is a form of
abduction where, given a rule and effect or a symptom, we can abduce the
cause of that problem, like an illness or a software bug. Both
Configuration and Diagnosis are small tasks in the broader process of
design. Diagnosis is typically performed when our expectations of a
system are violated.

Mycin is a medical expert system that diagnoses illness. This is just an example of its capabilities:
