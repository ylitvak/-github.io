Now that we understand abduction, and now that we know the diagnosis is
an instance of abduction, let us ask ourselves, how does this
understanding help us in choosing hypotheses? So the first principle for
choosing a hypothesis is explanatory coverage. A hypotheses must cover
as much of the data as possible. Here’s an example, hypotheses H3
explain data items D1 through D8. Hypothesis H7 explains data item D5 to
D9. Assuming that all of these data elements are equally important or
equally salient, we may prefer H3 over H7 because it explains for of the
data than does H7. The second principle for choosing between competing
hypotheses is called the principle of Parsimony. All things being equal,
we want to pick the simplest explanation for the data. So consider the
following scenario. H2 explains data elements D1 to D3. H4 explains data
elements D1 through D8. H6 explains data elements D4 to D6 and H8
explains data elements D7 to D9. Now if you went by the criteria of
explanatory coverage, then we might pick H2, plus H6, plus H8, because
the three of them combined, explain more than just H4. However, the
criteria of Parsimony would suggest if you pick H4, because H4 alone,
explains almost all the data, and we don’t need the other three
hypothesis. In general this is a balancing act between these two
principles. We want to both maximize the coverage, and maximize the
parsimony. Based on this particular example, we may go with H4 and H8.
The two together explain all the data and in addition, the set of these
two hypotheses is smaller than these set of hypotheses H2, H6, and H8.
The [Ashok’s] criteria for choosing between competing hypotheses is that
we want to pick those hypotheses in which we have more confidence. Some
hypotheses are more likely than others. You may have more confidence in
some hypotheses than in others. As an example, in this particular
scenario, H3 may explain data items D1 to D8 and H5 may explain more
data elements from D1 to D9. So H5 also explains D9 that H3 doesn’t.
However, we may have more confidence in H3, and so we may pick H3
instead of H5. Once again this is a balancing act between these three
criteria for choosing between competing diagnostic hypotheses. A quick
point to note here, these three criteria are useful for choosing between
competing hypotheses even if the task is not diagnosis. The same problem
occurs for example in intelligence analysis. Imagine that you have some
data that needs to be explained and your competing hypothesis for
explaining that particular data, well, you may pick between the
competing hypothesis based on this criteria. All of the task is not a
diagnostic task. These three criteria are useful for explanation.
Diagnosis simply happens to be an example of this [Ashok’s] task.
