Now we said earlier, the diagnosis is mapping from data space to
hypothesis space. We also noted that although we may start with the
initial set of data, proposals of specific hypotheses will lead us to
collect additional data. Once we have some hypotheses for explaining the
available data, then this hypotheses become indices into treatment
plans. So the next step is to map the hypothesis space to the treatment
space. In case of medical diagnosis, this might be a set of therapies,
or a set of drugs. In case of auto mechanics the treatment space might
consist of replacement of various parts or repair of various parts. Note
here in the power of classification, this was the space of percepts,
this was the space of actions, this mapping is very complicated. So we
map the space of percepts into the equal classes in these catergories So
we index the actions over the equal classes in these catergories so the
data index the actions of the data space. As we exited the treatment, we
monitor it. And depending upon the result of this treatment, we may need
to collect additional data. The treatment fails. And the fact that the
treatment has failed is important data that might also lead to the
collection of additional data. Thus in case of auto mechanics, if I
replace a particular component and the car still does not function
properly, then that is useful data to know. Because it suggests that the
fault that I thought would explain the malfunction is probably not the
right diagnosis. We could also think of this last phase as a type of
configuration, which we talked about last time. Given a set of
hypotheses about illnesses or faults with a car, we can then configure a
set of treatments or repairs that best address the faults we discovered
before.
