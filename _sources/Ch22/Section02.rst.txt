|Exercise Diagnosing Illness| 

To illustrate the task of diagnosis, let us begin with an exercise. When
we think of diagnosis, most of us think in terms of medical diagnosis.
The kind of diagnosis a doctor does. So this particular exercise, is
coming from medical diagnosis, actually it’s a made-up exercise from
medical diagnosis. And here’s a set of diseases, fictional diseases,
that the doctor knows about, along with the symptoms that each diseases
causes. So, Alphaitis, for example, causes elevated A, reduced C and
elevated F and so on. Given this set of data, and this set of diseases,
what disease or set of diseases do you think the patient suffers from?
