|Assignment Diagnosis| 

So would the idea of diagnosis help us design an agent that can answer
Raven’s progressive matrices? Perhaps the best way to think about this
is to consider how your agent might respond when it answers a question
wrong. First, what data will it use to investigate its incorrect answer?
Second, what hypotheses might it have for incorrect answers? Third, how
will it select a hypothesis that best explains that data? And last, once
it’s selected hypothesis that explains that data, how will it use that
to repair its reasoning, so it doesn’t make the same mistake again?
