Diagnosis is a very common cognitive task. It occurs whenever our

expectations are violated. We start diagnosing. Why were our
expectations violated? Within a system, we expect some behavior out of
it. We get a different behavior. Why did the system not give the
behavior we expected from it? Notice that diagnosis is a task. We can
use several methods to address it, like case-based reasoning. We have
discussed diagnosis on several contexts like medicine, program
debugging, car repair, but itâ€™s also very common in other aspects of our
life. For example, you get unexpected traffic. Why did it occur? We
review interaction with a co-worker or the economy. All are examples of
diagnosis
