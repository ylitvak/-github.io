Let us look at abduction more closely. To understand the similarities
and differences between deduction, abduction and induction, let us look
at the relationship between a rule, cause and effect. Let’s consider a
simple rule like, if it cloudy, it rains. So it is cloudy, is the cause.
It rains, is the effect. If it’s cloudy and it rains, it’s a rule.
Another example of a rule, would be the rule that Bob hates Joe. So Bob
hates Joe, so whenever Joe walks in, Bob leaves. The cause is Joe
walking in. The effect is Bob leaving. And the rule is Bob hates Joe.
You already come across yet another instance of this particular
arrangement, when we were talking about flu and fever. So the rule might
be; if flu then fever. Flue is the cause. Fever is the effect.
Non-deduction, in one fundamental kind of inference. We know the rule
and the cause, and we need to deduce the effect. So, given the rule, if
it is cloudy, then it rains, and given the cause, it is cloudy, we can
deduce that it rains. Similarly, in our rule that Bob hates Joe, we can
say that if Joe just walked in, we can deduce that Bob will leave. Part
of the rule is, if flu, then fever. And we know that a shortcut’s flu,
then we can deduce that, a shortcut’s fever. This is simply an instance
of more despondence, and we discussed this in detail when we were
talking about logic. Now let us look at induction. Given a relationship
between a cause and an effect, we can try to induce a rule. For example,
if we observe repeatedly that when it is cloudy, it rains, and we may
induce a rule. If it is cloudy, then it rains. Same thing with Bob and
Joe. If we observe repeatedly that every time Joe arrives, Bob leaves.
we can induce a rule that Bob must hate Joe. If every time a patient
goes to a doctor with flu, and the patient has fever, then we can induce
a rule if flu then fever. In can of abduction, given a rule and an
effect, we can abduce a cause. As an example, given the rule if it is
cloudy then it rains, and the effect that it is raining, we can ask of
ourselves is it cloudy. And once again with Bob and Joe, given our rule
that Bob hates Joe, and given that we just arrived at the party, and we
see that Joe is here but not Bob, we might be able to adduce that Bob
left when Joe arrived. Or given the rule, if flu then fever and that
fact Ashok that has fever, we might be able to adduce that Ashok has
flu. First of all notice that we are back to diagnosis. Diagnosis is an
instance of abduction. But notice several of the properties. First,
deduction is truth preserving. If the rule is true, and the cause is
true, we can always guarantee that the effect is true as well. Induction
and abduction are not truth-preserving. If we know something of the
relations between cause and effect for some sample, that does not mean
that the same relationship holds for the entire population. Induction
does not always guarantee correctness. Same for abduction. We may know
the rule and the effect, and we may suppose that the cause is true. But
that need not necessarily be true. It may be the case the flu then
fever. And Ashark may have fever, but that does not necessarily mean
that a shark has flu. Fever can be caused by many many things. The
reason that fever does not necessarily mean that Ashkk has flu is
because there can be multiple causes for the same effect. Multiple
hypothesis for the same data. This is exactly the problem that we had
encountered earlier, when we were talking about what makes diagnosis
hard. We said that deduction, induction, and abduction, are three of the
fundamental forms of inference. We can of course also combine these
inferences, science is a good example, you and I as scientists, observe
some data about the world. Then we induced some explanation for it.
Having induced such an explanation for it, we induce a rule. Having
induced a rule, now we can use production to predict new data elements.
We going to observe some more. Again, we adduce, induce, deduce. And we
continue the cycle. Might the cycle also explain a significant part of
cognition? Is this what you and I do on a daily basis? Adduce, induce,
deduce?
