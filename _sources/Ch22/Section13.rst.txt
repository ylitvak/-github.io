|Wrap Up| 

So today, we talked about diagnosis which is a term weâ€™re very familiar
with from our everyday lives. But today, we talked about it specifically
in a knowledge-based AI sense. We started off by defining diagnosis,
which is finding the fault responsible for the malfunction in some
system. This can be computers, computer programs, cars or even people
and animals. We then talked about the process of diagnosis, mapping data
onto hypotheses and how we can see this as a form of classification. We
discovered though that this can be a very complicated process and
classification might not get us all the way there. So then we talked
about diagnosis as a form of abduction. Given a rule and effect or a
symptom, we can abduce the cause of that problem, like an illness or a
software bug. Both configuration and diagnosis have been small tasks in
the broader process of design. Now that we talk about them, we can talk
about AI agents that can actually do design in the real world, as well
as what it would mean for an AI agent to really be creative.
