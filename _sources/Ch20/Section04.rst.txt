|Exercise Gibberish Sentences| 
To look more deeply into the processing that might be a [occurring in
our] visual system, that allows us to identify which objects are 3D
objects and which ones are just 2D. Let us consider a different example.
Shown here are six sentences. None of the sentence makes much sense
semantically. Nevertheless, some of the sentences are grammatically
correct. And you and I can quickly detect which of the sentences are
grammatically correct. Can you identify which of the sentences are
grammatically correct?
