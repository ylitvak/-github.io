|Exercise Recognizing 3D Figures 1| 
To illustrate the technique of constraint propagation, let us consider
this figure drawn on a 2D surface. Although this figure has been drawn
on a 2D surface, you and I can almost immediately recognize that this is
a 3D cube. How did we recognize that this is a 3D cube? How can we help
machines do it? Cube is an example of a trihedral object. A trihedral
object is one with three surfaces joined at a particular point, at this
particular point. In general, what [one can have] a polyhedral surfaces.
A polyhedral surface is one where multiple surfaces join at the same
point. So a soccer ball, with its white and black patterns, is an
example of a polyhedral object because at one point several surfaces can
join. A pyramid is another good example of a polyhedral object. A
pyramid has four surfaces joining, at the apex. So letâ€™s do a simple
exercise together. Here are six figures all drawn on a 2D surface. Which
of these six figures do you think represents a 3D object?
