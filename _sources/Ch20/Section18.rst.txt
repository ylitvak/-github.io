Constraint propagation also connects to human cognition. First,
constraint propagation is a very general purpose method like, means
analysis. In both knowledge based AI and in human cognition, constraint
propagation allows us to use our knowledge of the world, in order to
make sense of it. Constraints can be of any kind. Symbolic, as well as
numeric. We discussed symbolic constraints in today’s lesson. A good
example of numeric constraints comes from XL spreadsheets, with which
most of you are familiar. If the columns in a particular spreadsheet are
connected to some formula, and you make a change in one column, then the
change is propagated into all the columns of the spreadsheet. That’s an
example of Numerical Constraint Propagation. We have seen constraint
propagation under other topics as well. For example, planning, and
understanding, and scripts. The next topic, configuration, will build on
this notion of constraint propagation.
