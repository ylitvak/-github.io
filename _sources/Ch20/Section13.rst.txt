|Exercise Assembling the Cube II 1| 
Thatâ€™s good, David. Note that David started on the top left corner, this
is a random selection. He could have started at any other corner, for
example, this one or that one. And found the same answer and that is
because we have simplified these constraints. But now that we know that
this line is a fold, by the definition of fold, we know that two
surfaces must be meeting at this line. It follows then, that this must
be a surface and this must be a surface. Similarly, because we know this
is a fold and by definition of a fold, two surfaces must be meeting
here. Follows this is a surface, this is a surface and so on. And now we
have identified that this one surface, this is another surface, this is
a third surface. In this way, the visual system used knows the different
kinds of junctions in the world of triangular objects, and it constrains
at each of these junctions to figure out which of these lines made
surfaces. Instead of thinking of this as one single surface, the visual
system identified this as being composed of three different surfaces.
And now we can recognize that this might be a cube.
