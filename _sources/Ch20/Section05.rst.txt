|Exercise Gibberish Sentences 1| 
Which ones did you think, David? So the first sentence, colorless green
ideas sleep furiously. I recognized pretty quickly as a pretty famous
example proposed by Noam Chomsky of how sentences can be semantically
nonsensical, but still grammatically correct. The sentence makes sense.
There’s still a subject, a verb, an adverb describing the verb, but the
idea of a colorless green idea makes no sense. The idea of ideas
sleeping makes maybe a little bit of sense. The idea of sleeping
furiously is kind of nonsense. So the sentence really doesn’t have much
meaning even though it is grammatically correct. The second sentence,
soft drinks due from thank bills insurance really doesn’t make any
grammatical sense. It does have a seeming subject and a seeming verb.
But the verb comes right a preposition suggesting that the verb fills in
the slot proposed by the preposition, which doesn’t make any sense. So
this one doesn’t make any grammatical sense to me. The same can be said
for the other two negative examples. They don’t really have the normal
subject, predicate sentence structure or they have other rules or
constraints that are being violated. For the other two positive
examples, they still maintain this subject verb sentence structure. So
here we have wall decor notifies, which doesn’t make sense but it
matches our structure. And here we have Tuesday brought something, which
also makes no semantic sense, but can still be thought of as
grammatically correct. Similarly, Tuesday bringing something does make
some sense, but a a sharp-edged suite of pumpernickel makes no sense
whatsoever. Note the vocabulary that David used in trying to find out
which of these sentences were grammatically correct. It seemed to me
that he was examining if the structure of these sentences was fulfilling
certain conditions or fulfilling certain constraints that he expects
from his knowledge of English-language grammar. One could even say that
he was doing constraint processing.
