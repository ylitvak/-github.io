|Wrap Up| 
So today we’ve talked about constraint propagation, which is a method of
inference where we assign values to variables to satisfy certain
external constraints. By doing so, we arrive at strong inferences about
the problem, like which shapes represent objects, or how the words in a
sentence interact. After defining constraint propagation, we talked
about how it can be useful in interpreting images by using prior
knowledge of constraints to anticipate predictable shapes out in the
world. Then we talked about natural language understanding, where prior
knowledge of the rules of grammar and parts of speech allow us to make
sense of new sentences. Now, constraint propagation is actually an
incredibly complex process. We have numerous constraints for visual
scenes and verbal sentences that we haven’t discussed here. We all see
this constraint propagation in other areas as well, such as in making
sense of auditory and tactile information. Reading braille for instance,
can be seen as an instance of constraint propagation. We’ll pick up on
this discussion later when we talk about visual and spatial reasoning.
But this will also come up in our discussion of configuration, which can
be seen as a specific instance of constraint propagation in the context
of design.
