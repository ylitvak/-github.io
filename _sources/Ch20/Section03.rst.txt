|Exercise Recognizing 3D Figures 2| 
What do you think, David? So I said that four of them could represent a
3D object. This could be a cylinder. This is some kind of trapezoidal
prism, and this kind of looks like a pyramid from above with the top
blocked off. We gotta see this as looking down at some kind of pyramid
or we might also see this as looking into a box. This one is a bit of an
interesting example. It doesn’t as naturally lend itself to
interpretation as a 3D figure. But at the same time, we can imagine that
that’s what you would get if you looked at this figure directly down.
David, it is interesting that you did not pick this as an answer, as
well. I guess I would have picked that one. I see this as an x-axis, the
y-axis, and the z-axis. And because all three axis can be identified
here, I would have thought of this, too, as an example of a 3D object.
That’s interesting, Ashok. Now that you mention it, I can’t stop seeing
it as a 3D object. Now I see it as kind of a folded piece of paper that
just has a line drawn at the center. Initially, I don’t think I looked
at that as a 3D object, because I saw the lines as having to represent
places where the figure folded or where different planes met. But if we
look at the line at the middle as just kind of something drawn on the
figure, it immediately pops out as a 3D object for me. And this brings
us to the point of this exercise. The point of the exercise is that
clearly some kind of processing is agreeing in our visual system. That
allows us to group these lines and these surfaces in ways. So that we
can identify which one of them is a 3D object, and which one of them is
not a 3D object. Clearly, this processing is not completely definitive,
in that sometimes it is ambiguity. You might come up with one answer to
this, and someone else may come up with a slightly different to this
because the processing leaves room for ambiguity.
