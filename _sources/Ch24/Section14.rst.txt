So today we've talked about meta-reasoning. This very strongly leveraged and built on nearly everything we've talked about so far in this course. Meta-reasoning is, in many ways, reasoning about everything we've covered so far. We started off by recapping learning from correcting mistakes and the related notion of gaps. Then we covered two broad metacognitive techniques called strategy selection and strategy integration. We then discussed whether or not meta-meta-reasoning might exist. And we decided, ultimately, that such a distinction isn't even necessary. After all, the structures involved in meta-reasoning, like cases, and rules, and models, and the same as those involved in a reasoning, itself. So, meta-reasoning is already equipped to reason about itself. Finally, we discussed a particular example of meta-reasoning, called goal-based autonomy. Meta-reasoning is in many ways the capstan of our course. It covers reasoning of all the topics we've covered so far, and it provides a way that they can be used in conjunction with one another. We do have a few more things to talk about though, and we'll cover those in our Advanced Topics lesson.
