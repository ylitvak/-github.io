That's why we have talked about some of the uses of metacognition. We can use it to fix errors in knowledge or reasoning or learning. We can use it to fix gaps in knowledge, reasoning, or learning. We can use it for strategy integration. One that we have not yet talked about is what is the processes that metacognition uses? What is it's strategy? Well, metacognition can use these same kinds of reasoning processes that is the surface reasoning goal. That is, case-based reasoning is a potential strategy for metacognition. Constraint propagation is a potential strategy for metacognition, and so on. Let us take an example, supposedly if metacognition comes across a problem and it must select among these strategies. Metacognition might ask itself, what strategy did I pick the last time I came across a similar problem? This is case-based reasoning at a meta level. To complete this example, metacognition might say the last time I used constraint propagation as a technique with this particular problem, this time I'll use constraint propagation again. As another example, given a second problem, metacognition may use planning to set up a plan for using the various strategies, thinking of each of the strategies as an operator. As a third example, metacognition might get a new problem and decide to use every single method at it's disposal to generate a possible solution. It then might have some heuristics to test each one of those possible solutions and figure out which one is best. So then it's using Generate & Test to select between it's multiple strategies. To summarize this part then, metacognition can use the same reasoning strategies that we have been studying at the deliberative level.
