So personally, I would say no, this is not a good way to reason over it. We talked about in the previous portion of the lesson that Metacognition uses the same strategies that it reasons over. It reasons over case based reasoning. It reasons over means and analysis. It reasons over problem reduction. But it also uses case based reasoning, problem reduction, means and analysis and the others to do that reasoning. So it really doesn't need an additional layer, it's already equipped with the ability to reason over case based reasoning in the other methods, so it can just reason over itself. This is really cool, so agents don't need multiple levels of Metacognition because Metacognition reasons over itself recursively. In fact, current theories of Metacognition all talk about this kind of two layer system between Deliberation and Metacognition.
