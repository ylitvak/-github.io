So if metacognition reasons over deliberation, could we also have an additional layer, where meta-metacognition reasons over metacognition? And to take that even further, could we have a meta-meta-metacognition reasons over meta-metacognition all the way up, infinitely up in a hierarchy? Is this a good way to think about the levels of metacognition?
