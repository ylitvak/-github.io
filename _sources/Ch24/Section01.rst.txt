Today we will talk about Meta-Reasoning. Meta-Reasoning is thinking about thinking, knowledge about knowledge. In this case, the agent does not reasoning about something outside in the world. Instead, the agent is reasoning about itself, but its own knowledge, its own reasoning, its own learning. As an example, I can ask you what is President Obama's telephone number? I'm sure that all of you can immediately tell me, you don't know. But how do you know, that you don't know? We test a little bit about meta-reasoning when we were talking about learning by correcting mistakes. There, we were interested in errors in the knowledge base. In journal, errors can also be in reasoning or in learning. We'll start today by talking about mistakes in reasoning and learning, in addition to mistakes in knowledge. Then we'll talk about knowledge gaps, not just errors in the knowledge, but when some knowledge is actually missing. Then we'll talk about a very journal meta-cognitive skill, which leads to strategy selection and integration. And this class, we have talked about a large number of methods, but we haven't yet talked about how an intelligent agents can put multiple methods together to address a complex problem. Then we'll discuss meta-meta-reasoning. Or meta-meta-meta-reasoning, how far can we go? Finally, we'll discuss an example of meta-reasoning election that is sometimes called goal-based autonomy.
