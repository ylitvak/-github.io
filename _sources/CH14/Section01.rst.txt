Today, we will talk about understanding. Understanding is a very big general world. We’ll be talking about understanding of even some stories in the world. Understanding will be very heavily on what we learn about Frames. And it will help us set up the infrastructure for learn- ing about common sense reasoning in the next lesson. We’ll start with talking about thematic role systems, which are the most structured type of frame representation. Then we’ll talk about how these roles, these thematic roles can be used to resolve ambiguity in understanding the world. Finally, we’ll talk about how grammar and other constraints can be used to guide our interpretation of the world.
