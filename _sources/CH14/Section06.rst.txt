What did you write, David? So we start with a verb, and the verb here is went, which is the past tense of the action go. Our agent here is David, myself, because I’m the one doing the action, I’m the one going. The coagent is Ashok, because I’m going with Ashok. The destination is to the meeting, and the conveyance here is by car, so car is the conveyance. That’s right, David. But how did we know that David was the agent? How did we know that the destination was the meeting? How did we know that car was the conveyance? That’s what we’ll look at next.
