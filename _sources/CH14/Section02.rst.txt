We’ll use story understanding, To examine the general processes of understanding. Here are two stories that we have encountered earlier. The first story is talking about the earthquake that hit lower Slabovia and caused some damage. The second story is talking about the President of lower Slabovia who killed a number of proposals. Both of them deal with killing. But the meaning of the two stories are very, very different. Humans make use of stories to understand the world around them. The world offers a very large amount of data at any given time. We use the stories to provide structure to that data, to make coherent sense of it. When we discuss these two stories earlier, using frame as a knowledge representation language, we found that we could have a frame of this notion of killing, killing of 25 people, and this notion of killing, killing of 25 proposals. And there was no simple way in the frame knowledge representation to disambiguate between those two meanings of killing. Now we’ll examine how we can construct a different interpretation of the first story, or the interpretation of the second story, based on different interpretations of the word killing in the two stories. In order to make the two stories simpler, and to illustrate our point, we’re going to focus on one sentence from each story, sentences that contain the word kill. Humans that have lived through difficulty and understanding the first sentence means completely different from the second sentence be- cause the killed in the first sentence means some- thing completely different from the killed in the second sentence. How can we build an err program that can do the same thing? We will see that err program will need to use a lot of back- ground knowledge in order to be able to do that, and that would generate hypotheses about how humans might be using that background knowledge to similarly disambiguate between different senses of the word killed.
