Section 17: Summary
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Understanding is the framework used for common-sense reasoning. Thematic role systems are the most structured type of frame representation and help resolve ambiguity in understanding the world. Agents make sense of stories, events and other things in the world around them using Understanding. The Thematic Role Systems captures verbs and tell us what to expect in certain events and also handle conflicts and thus disambiguate meaning. Constraints and certain words or frames help constrain the meanings of a sentence and help us figure out ambiguous meanings.
