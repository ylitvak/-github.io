In order to start resolving ambiguities of the kind the occur with the earthquake story, we need a new knowledge representation called a traumatic rule system. A traumatic rule system is a type of frame system, where the frame rep- resents an action or event identified by a word. The word caused forth a number of expectations about the roles that are connected with that particular event. David, can you think of an example of the thematic-role frame? So one simple example that comes to mind for me is the word throw. I know that if a throw action has taken place, a few things have to be in play. I expect there to be someone doing the throwing. I expect something to be thrown. I might expect a target specified by the word at or a destination specified by the word to. So, for example, I throw the ball to a choke, or I throw the ball at a choke, depending on how nice I’m feeling. [LAUGH] Note that even though David isn’t talking about a specific instance of throwing, he’s still able to generate expectations with the general action of throwing. This shows what a traumatic case frame does for you. It is able to generate expectations. Let us look at how it would actually work in action.
