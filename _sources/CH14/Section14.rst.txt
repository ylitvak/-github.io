So how would you use the notion of under- standing [thematic] frames, constraint, and ambiguity to address Raven’s progressive matrices? One example of an application here, would be to the idea of multiple possible transformations, that we saw in some of our earlier problems. We saw certain problems that could be solved with either rotation or a reflection, but they would give different answers. You might imagine a frame that dictates certain expected values for different transformations. And the degree of fit to those expectations can dictate the accuracy of that particular answer. Try to think of the different phases of the understanding process. How do you first understand what’s happening in the problem? How do you fit that, into a thematically role frame representation? And how would that representation then help you transfer and solve the problem?
