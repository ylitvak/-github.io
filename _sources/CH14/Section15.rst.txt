So today we’ve talking about understanding, which how agents make sense of stories, events and other things in the world around them. We started off by creating a more formal type of frame representation called thematic role systems that captures verbs and tell us what to expect in certain events. We then talked about how single verbs can actually have ambiguous meanings. But thematic role frames can help us differentiate which meaning a verb has in a particular sentence. Finally we talked about constraints and how certain words or frames can constrain the possible meanings of a sentence and help us figure out those ambiguous meanings. Today we’ve largely been talking about how single words or phrases can have multiple possible meanings, but next time we’ll do this in reverse. We’ll talk about how multiple words or multiple phrases or multiple sentences can actually have the same meaning. We’ll talk about how we can discern that sameness, and then re- act accordingly.
