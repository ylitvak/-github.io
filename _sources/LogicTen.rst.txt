The connection between logic and human cognition is interesting. Logic is a very important school of thought in AI, for several reasons. One reason is that logic provides a very formal and precise way of reasoning. Another reason is that logic provides a formal notation for expressing how intelligent agents reason, whether or not they’re using logical reasoning. But does this mean that logic is also the basis of cognition? It suddenly appears that humans use logic some of the time. For example, I may have a statement like if I get a big bonus, I’ll take a long vacation. I did get a big bonus, therefore I may infer I’ll take a long vacation. This is clearly. But simply because of a behavior appears to be logical, does not necessarily imply that we use logic as a fundamental reasoning strategy. I might solve a new problem, by analogy to a previously encountered problem, I did not use logic, but my behavior appears to be logical. The logic that we have considered so far is deductive logic. But a lot of human reasoning is inductive or abductive in its character. If you haven’t come across an abductive so far, we will discuss in detail later in the class. Deduction has to do with reasonings from causes to effects. Abduction has to do with reasoning from effects to causes. When you go to a doctor, you go with some signs and symptoms. Those are the effects. The doctor comes up with a disease category. That’s the cause. Abduction is reasoning from data to an explanation to a disease category for the data. Induction is given some relationship between cause and effect for a sample. How do we generalize it between a cause and effect relationship for a population? So while human reasoning appears to be inductive and abductive in character much of the time, the logic that we have considered so far is deductive. That’s yet another issue that we’ll return to later in the class.

Section 49: Summary
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Logic provide the framework for formal notation/language for reasoning and inferences. In other words, logic provides a formal and precise way of reasoning. It also allows agents to reason more formally about initial and goals states and helps in planning. Deduction is term used for reasoning from causes to effects; Abduction is the term used for reasoning from effects to causes; and Induction is generating a generic rule, given the cause and its effect.

Exercise 1:

It is said that a cat attempts to pass through a narrow space (such as the bars on a window) only if the width of the space is more than the size of its whiskers. Now consider a robot cat, which doesn't have any whiskers. The robot cat attempts to pass through the window bars if the coast is clear, e.g., there is no dog around. Sometimes however the robot cat gets trapped between bars as it attempts to pass through. So the robot cat has the following propositions: COAST CLEAR, BARS PASSABLE, and TRAPPED. Write the fact that if the coast is clear and the bars are passable, then the robot will not get trapped as a logical implication. Now when the robot cat gets trapped between the bars, show how it can use resolution to figure out that the bars are not passable after all.
