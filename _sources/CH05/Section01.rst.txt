*In the final analysis, means and ends must cohere because the ends is preexistent in the means, and, ultimately, destructive means cannot bring about constructive ends.*

Today we will discuss two other very general AI methods of problem solving called means end analysis and problem reduction. Like generate and test these two methods, means analysis and problem reduction, are really useful for very well-formed problems. Not all problems are well- formed. But some problems are. And then these methods are very useful. These three methods, generate and test, means-ends analysis, form reduction, together with semantic networks as a knowledge representation, form the basic unit of all fundamental topics in this course. We’ll be- gin with the notion of state spaces. Then talk about means-end analysis. Then we’ll illustrate means-end analysis as a matter for solving problems and then we’ll move onto the method of problem reduction.
