So, the operation of putting A on B will bring us to this state. Given this state, we can have, again, apply a means of analysis. Again, I'm not sure that all these states here, but Iâ€™d like you to find out how many possible states are there and how many of those states reduce the difference to the goal described.

.. fillintheblank:: Ch0514

    .. blank:: blank0514
        :correct: \\b(3|three|Three|THREE)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "Try again")

        How many possible next states are there?

.. fillintheblank:: Ch05142

    .. blank:: blank05142
        :correct: \\b(0|zero|Zero|ZERO)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "Try again")

        How many possible next states are there?
