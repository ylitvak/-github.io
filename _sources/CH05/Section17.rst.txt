So how do you use means ends analysis to solve Raven’s Progressive Matrices? What exactly is our goal in this context? You might think of the goal in different ways. We might think of it as, the goal is to solve the problem or in a different sense we might think of the goal as the transform sum frame into another frame. And then trace back and find what the transformation was? In that context how would you then measure distance? We noticed that distance is important in doing means ends analysis because that helps us decide what to do next. Once you have a measure of how to actually measure distance to your goal what are the individual operators or moves that you can take to actually move closer to your goal and how would you weight them to be able to decide what to do at any given time. In addition, what are the overall strengths of using means and analysis as a problem solving approach in this context, and what are its limitations. Is it well suited for these problems, or are there perhaps other things that we can be doing that aren’t necessarily under this topic that would actually make the problem even easier.
