What answers did you come up with David? So for the first one, if we put A up on D, we haven’t accomplished any of the goals that we hadn’t already accomplished. So our difference is still 3. Similarly, for putting D on A, our difference is also still 3, because then we haven’t accomplished anything new. However, if we put D down on the table, we’ve accomplished one of the goals we hadn’t accomplished before. So there, our difference is 2. Good, David. So, in each state, David is comparing the state with the goal state, and finding differences between them.
