What sequence did you come up with, David? So from this state, there’s seven possible moves we can make initially. Some of them are going to move us away from our goal state. So putting D on A or D on B are going to move us away from our goal state. To means and to analysis, the rest of the moves are relatively the same. Putting A on B doesn’t get us closer, putting B on C doesn’t get us closer, and putting B on D doesn’t get us closer. However, we can see that we really need to get B out of the way of C to move it up here. Like Ashok mentioned, later on we’ll talk about how an agent would decide that it needs to get B out of the way of C. But for right now, let’s just go ahead and choose B on Table as the next move. Given that, we now see that of the next possible states, only one re- duces our difference, and that’s to put C up on D. That was the right answer, David. Thank you. You will note that we’re leaving several questions unanswered for now, and that is fine. But you will also note that this round reduction helps us make progress towards solving the problem.
