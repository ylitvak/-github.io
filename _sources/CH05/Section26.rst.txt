So the application of the last move in the previous shot will bring us to this state. In this state the the sub-goal C over D has been achieved. Now that weâ€™ve achieved the first sub-goal, we can worry about achieving the other sub-goals. The other sub-goals, recall, were B over C and A over B. Given this as the current state and this as the goal state. Please write down the sequence of operations that will take us from the current state to the goal state.

   :match_1: Move(A, B)|||Move(B, C)
   :match_2: Move(B, C)|||Move(A, B)


   Drag the operators on the left in the correct order that will move the blocks into the goal state.
