Given this current state, we can apply means ends analysis veritably. Now, if we apply means on some of those to this particular state, the number of choices here is very large, so I will not go through all of them here. But Iâ€™d like you to write down the number of possible next states. As well as, how many of those states reduce the difference to the goal? Which is given here.


.. fillintheblank:: Ch0513

    .. blank:: blank0513
        :correct: \\b(7|seven|Seven|SEVEN)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "Try again")

        How many possible next states are there?

.. fillintheblank:: Ch05132

    .. blank:: blank05132
        :correct: \\b(1|one|One|ONE)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "Try again")

        How many of those states reduce the difference to the goal?
