What answers did you come up with, David? So I counted out seven possible next states. We can put B on A, B on D, B on the table, A on B, A on D or D on B or D on A. So that’s seven total operations. Of those, only one of them accomplishes a goal we hadn’t already accomplished, and that’s putting A up on B. That’s good, David.
