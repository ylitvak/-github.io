Summary:

1. Memory is as important as Learning/Reasoning so that we can fetch the answer to similar cases encountered in the past and avoid having to redo the non-trivial task of learning and reasoning, thereby saving effort.

2. A case is an encapsulation of a past experience that can be applied to a large number of similar situations in future. The similarity metric can be as simple as the Euclidean distance metric or a complex metric involving higher dimensions.

3. kNN method is one method to find the most similar case from memory for a new problem.

4. In some cases, we need to adapt the cases from our memory to fit the requirements of the new problem. In some cases, we also need to
store cases based on qualitative labels along with numeric labels to make the comparison applicable for particular situations.

5. Learning by storing cases in memory has a very strong connection to cognition since human cognition works in a similar manner by recording cases and applying them to new problems in real world by exploting the
patterns of regularity in them.
