You're right, David. Of the various blocks given here, this block best resembles the black block. And therefore the best guess would be, this is in fact, a black block. This is an example of learning by recording cases, because six cases were recorded in the agent's memory. So when now when a new problem comes along, then the agent gives an answer to that new problem based on the cases that it already had recorded in its memory, it simply sees which case most closely resembles the new situation. And gives the answer to the new situation for that most closely resembling case.
