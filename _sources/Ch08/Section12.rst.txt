For this assignment, talk about how you might use notion of recording cases to design an agent that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. You might think of cases in a variety of different ways here. For example, each figure in a problem could be a case. Each transformation between figures could be a case. Or more broadly, each problem that your agent has encountered in the past could be a case. As part of this, you'll also need to think about how to evaluate similarity. If you're using figures, how do you evaluate the similarity between two figures in a problem? Or how do you evaluate the similarity between two transformations and a problem? Or more broadly, how do you find what problem that you face in the past, is most similar to the new one you're facing now?
