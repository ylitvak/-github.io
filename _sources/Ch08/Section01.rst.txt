*Science is built upon facts, as a house is built of stones; but an accumulation of facts is no more a
science than a heap of stones is a house.

Today we'll talk about learning by recording cases. This is our first topic of learning, one of the fundamental elements of knowledge-based AI. It is also a first topic in analogical reasoning, often considered to be a core process of cognition. We'll start talking about recording cases in a general sense. Then we'll discuss a specific method for recording cases called the nearest neighbor method. We'll generalize this method into the k-nearest neighbor method and end by talking about complex cases in the real world.
