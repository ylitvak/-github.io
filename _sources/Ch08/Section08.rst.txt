So, here is a map of a small portion of Long Island, New York. Imagine there is an automated car that can navigate the streets of this neighborhood. It comes from the factory with these six cases bootstrapped in it. A, B, C, and so on. For the time being, assume that the car navigates it's way in this neighborhood solely by the method of learning where the car in case is. So all it can use is this cases that is knows about. Now, suppose that we have a new problem. The new problem is how to go from Q to this end destination denoted by the arrow. What route is most similar to this new problem?
