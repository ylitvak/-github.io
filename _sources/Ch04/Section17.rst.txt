Let us examine the relationship between the method of generate and test, and human cognition. Humans use generate and test as the problem-solving method all the time. This is be- cause we do not have complete or correct knowledge of the world. We do not have in nite computational resources. And we also do not always have recourse to a method of reasoning that is guaranteed to be correct. When you do not have these things, then you use your own test method. You come up with particular solutions to a problem, you test the solutions out. Beyond human cognition, I'm sure you've come across the notion of genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are inspired by the processes of biological evolution. Through operations like crossover and mutation, one can generate solutions that can then be tested against some fitness function. Genetic algorithm are a good example of the genetical test method. First, genetic solutions, then test them out. So this method of generating test is connected not only with human cognition, but dependently, also with biological evolution. It's all over the place.
