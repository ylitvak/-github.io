This is where the knowledge representation helps a lot. The semantic network knowledge representation provides a level of abstraction at which the problem gets represented and analyzed. So, although this particular diamond y could have been displaced here or a little bit further, it could have been of this size, maybe a little smaller, a little bit larger. The semantic network really doesn't care about it. With the level of extraction which a semantic network is dealing, y gets expanded, and that is all that matters. An important point to note here is that any knowledge representation picks a level of extraction at which it represents the world. There's a lot of power in it because that knowledge representation ignores things that are at a low level of detail. And therefore the problem- solving method doesn't have to worry about those things. So it is not the knowledge representation alone that solves the problem, or the problem solving method that solves the problem. It is the knowledge representation and the problem solving method coupled together that solve the problem, that provide the reasoning.
