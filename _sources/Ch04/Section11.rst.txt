David is right. The tester could, in fact, test and dismiss the state using the kind of rule David was talking about. But, David, do you think there is another way that this could be done? So, I guess, actually, the generator could do it as well. So, in this case, we could also have the generator say, I don't need to ever generate a state that involves sending one person over to an empty coast. That's always going to result in a state that the tester would have thrown out. And it's not going to result in any states that the tester wouldn't have thrown out. So, generator could do it, too. That sounds like a good answer to me. So once again, we are back to the issue of where do we draw the balance of responsibility between the generator and the tester? The important thing to note from here, however, is that generate and test, when endowed with the right kind of knowledge, can be a very powerful method.
