So let's assume that we're using semantic network as a representation for this particular class of problem. Given that, how would you apply generate and matter to this problem, David? So it sounds like would I would do is I would use the transformation between A and B, transfer that transformation to C and use it to generate my answer for D. I then take my answer for D and compare it against 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and see which one most closely matched what I generated. If I wanted to make my tester and genera- tor even smarter, I might say that in order to be the correct answer, it has to meet the generated answer with a certain level of confidence. And if it doesn't meet that level of confidence, it should go back and see if there's a different transformation we could have transferred. That would take care of the problem earlier where either the middle shape disappeared or the outer shape dis- appeared. That's a good answer, David. It is another way of solving this problem. It is an- other way of solving this problem using test and semantic networks. One could take one, put it under D. Generate the transformation from C to D and then test it against the transformation from A to B. One could do the same thing with 2, put 2 here into D, directly transformation tested against the transformation A to B. One could do this for all six choices and then find out, which one of these transformations is closest with the transformation from A to B. Thus, in this problem, one can use generate and test methods in two very different ways, all of the knowledge representation ribbon is the same. So knowledge representation captures some knowledge about the world at a level of abstraction. It is coupled with problem solving methods, but more than one problem solving method, more than one variation of a problem solving method might be applicable using technology representation.
