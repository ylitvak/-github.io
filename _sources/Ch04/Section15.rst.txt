So how would you use generate and test to actually solve Raven's Progressive Matrices? We've talked about this a little bit already, but take it a little bit further and talk about how you would actually implement the problem solving approach you've seen today. We talked about a couple different ways of going about it. We talked about generating multiple answers and testing them against the answer options. Or generating one answer and testing it more intelligently against the different options available to you. So talk about which one you would do and how you would actually implement it. In doing so, make sure to think of three by three problems as well. With more transformations and more figures going on, it can be a lot more difficult to figure out what to generate, and the problem space can explode very quickly. Also make sure to think about how you're actually going to in- fer the mapping between different figures in the problem. How do you know which shape in one frame maps up to a different shape in another frame? And then talk about how you would use that information to generate what you think the answer is.
