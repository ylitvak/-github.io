Let's wrap up our topic for today. So today, we've talked about generate and test, which is a very general purpose problem solving method. As Ashok mentioned earlier in our lesson, we see generate and test every day in our regular lives and it's something in which we engage very naturally. We talked about strong generators and strong testers and how we can build intelligence into one side or the other in order to make the problem solving process easier and more efficient. We also talked about how generating tests is more difficult and unconstrained domains and how our generator and tester need to be equipped with special kinds of knowledge in order to make this problem solvable. Next, we're going to be looking at two different problem solving methods that build on what we've seen today with generate and test. Means and analysis and problem reduction. Like generate and test, these are both very general purpose, but they're going to do things a little bit differently and make certain problems easier.
