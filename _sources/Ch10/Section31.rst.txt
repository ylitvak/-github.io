So today we've talked about one particular method for doing what's called incremental concept learning. We started by talking about why we need incremental concept learning. We have instances in the world where we encounter a limited number of examples. We need to discern a concept based on those limited examples. So we start by variablizing our current understanding to arrive at a more abstract notion of the concept. Then based on new positive or negative examples, we either generalize or specialize our understanding. We talked about a few heuristics for doing this, like the forbid link or require link heuristics. That allow us to develop a better concept based on new examples. Next we'll talk about classification where we leverage the concepts that we developed through incremental concept learning. But we'll also revisit incremental concept learning in some later lessons as well such as through version spaces, explanation based learning, and learning by correcting mistakes.
