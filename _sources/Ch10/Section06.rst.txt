Lets try one last example in this series. So, in this example, there are four blocks again. There are three bricks at the bottom and two on the side, not touching each other. And there is a wedge this time at the top, not a brick. Is this an example of the concept foo?

   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: In saying 'Yes', you're suggesting a more general model of foo: the object is a foo if it has any shape on top of its supports. A more specialized model would say that the shape on top must be a brick, which would mean that this is not a foo. We haven't seen enough examples to know which model is correct, though, so we're having trouble settling in to a level of specialization or generalization. That will be the main topic of this lesson: how to use new examples to help specialize and generalize an agent's model of a concept.
   :feedback_b: In saying 'No', you're suggesting a more specialized model of foo: the object is only a foo if the shape on top is a brick. A more general model would say that the shape on top can be anything, which would mean that this is a foo.

   Is this a foo?
