What do you think David? So this is kind of an interesting example. If we recall back in our original tree as to the incremental concept learning process, we saw that there was those do nothing bubbles, that if a negative example does not fit our current definition, we wouldn't actually modify our current definition. Here this doesn't even fit our current concept of a foo. Our current concept of a foo has a brick on top, whereas this is a wedge on top. So this doesn't even fit, so we don't actually need to change our concept, it doesn't fit already. Good, very good. If the example is a negative instance, and the current definition of the concept already excludes it, we don't have to do anything.
