What do you think, David? So it looks like the brick on the bottom supports the two bricks in the middle. So this brick supports those two bricks. And then those two bricks support the brick on the top. So those two bricks each support that top brick. Note that we've not yet got an example that tells us whether these links are required or not. So that's why these are supports and not must support, as we saw in our concept last time. Now we'll give you some more examples, some positive, some negative. And we'll ask you how the air agent will go about refining it's concept definition.
