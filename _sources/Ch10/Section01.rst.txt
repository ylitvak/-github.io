*The difficult we do immediately. The impossible takes a little longer.
-- US Armed Forces slogan*

*Learning and intelligence are intimately related to each other. It is usually agreed that a system capable of learning deserves to be called intelligent; and conversely, a system being considered as intelligent is, among other things, usually expected to be able to learn. Learning always has to do with the self-improvement of future behavior based on past experience.
-- Sandip Sen and Gerhard Weiss, Learning in Multiagent Systems*

Today we'll talk about incremental concept learning. In case based reasoning, we're storing new examples in memory. Today we'll talk about how we can abstract concepts out of those examples. This is our second major topic of learning. We'll start with the learning goal. Then we'll talk about very near spaces of learning like variabilization, specialization, and generalization. We'll also talk about heuristics for specializing and generalizing concepts as examples come in incrementally.
