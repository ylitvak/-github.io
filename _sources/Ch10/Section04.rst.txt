Let's try another example. This time, again, there are four blocks. There are two bricks, at the bottom and the top. And the two cylinders, both vertical, but they are touching each other. Is this an example of the concept foo based on what we have learned so far?

   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :answer_c: -
   :answer_d: -
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: It looks like your model of a foo differs from ours, but that's okay! We saw earlier that if the bricks supporting the top brick touch, then the object is not a foo. You seem to believe that the rule against touching only applies to bricks, which means that the cylinders touching is not a problem. That's a more general model than ours, but again, we haven't seen enough examples to know for sure which model is correct; all we can do is infer. Your model is more general than ours because it allows objects to be considered foos -- like this one -- that would not be considered foos in the other model.
   :feedback_b: That's our answer, too. We saw earlier that if the bricks supporting the top brick are touching, it's not a foo. We're specializing our model to say that any time the supports touch, it's not a foo. Note again the role specialization and generalization play here; we could have had a more general model of a foo that said, 'If the supports are bricks and they touch, then it is not a foo.' If that was our model, the cylinders touching would not be a problem because the rule against touching applies only to bricks. This would be a more general because it allows more configurations to be foos.

   Is this a foo?
