So for this assignment, discuss how you might use incremental concept learning to design an agent that can solve Raven's progressive matrices. What are the concepts that you're trying to learn in this case? What are you incrementing over? This might depend on the scope of your problem. So are you doing concept learning at the level of the individual problem? Or are you doing it between problems? What concepts are you learning here and how are you actually tweaking them over time? What would a specific concept look like? Or what would a general concept look like? Once you establish these concepts, how will actually help you solve knew problems? Or how are you going to instantiate them or leverage them in new problems that your agent faces?
