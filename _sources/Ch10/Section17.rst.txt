Let us do a series of exercises together. This time, the concept that the AI agent is going to learn about, I'll call it foo. Here is a first example the teacher gives to the AI program. All right, because there is only one example the only kind of learning that can occur here is variabilization. What do you think will be the values that can go in these boxes here that will variabalize these four bricks. Initially, they are brick one, brick two, brick three, brick four.

        :feedback1: ("block", "- You're right that the shape on top is a block, but right now we're assuming this is the first example of a foo that we've seen. In incremental concept learning, we start by erring on the side of specialization, so here we want to assume that each shape has to be exactly the shape we see here.")
        :feedback2: (".*", "- Your shape for the top box differs from ours. The shapes we understand are: brick, wedge, cylinder, arch, sphere, prism, pyramid, cone, bowl, block")

        Top:

        :correct: \\bbrick\\b
        :feedback1: ("block", "- You're right that the shape on the left is a block, but right now we're assuming this is the first example of a foo that we've seen.

        :feedback2: (".*", "- Your shape for the left box differs from ours. The shapes we understand are: brick, wedge, cylinder, arch, sphere, prism, pyramid, cone, bowl, block")

        Left:

    .. blank:: blank43
        :correct: \\bbrick\\b
        :feedback1: ("block", "- You're right that the shape on the right is a block, but right now we're assuming this is the first example of a foo that we've seen.

        :feedback2: (".*", "- Your shape for the right box differs from ours. The shapes we understand are: brick, wedge, cylinder, arch, sphere, prism, pyramid, cone, bowl, block")

        Right:

        :correct: \\bbrick\\b
        :feedback1: ("block", "- You're right that the shape on bottom is a block, but right now we're assuming this is the first example of a foo that we've seen.

        :feedback2: (".*", "- Your shape for the bottom box differs from ours. The shapes we understand are: brick, wedge, cylinder, arch, sphere, prism, pyramid, cone, bowl, block")
