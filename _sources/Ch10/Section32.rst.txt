Incremental concept learning is intimately connected with human cognition. We can adopt two views of learning. In one view of learning, the intelligent agent is given with a large number of examples. The agent's task, then, is to detect patterns of regularity in those examples and learn those patterns of regularity. In the alternative view, the agent is given one example at a time. And the agent has to gradually, incrementally learn concepts out of those examples. Now you and I as agents, as cognitive agents in our daily lives, deal with one example at a time. Rarely is it that we encounter millions or hundreds of thousands of examples given at once. Incremental concept learning is a lot closer than kind of learning that you and I as cognitive agents do.
