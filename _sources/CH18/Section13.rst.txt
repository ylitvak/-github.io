What do you think, David? What are the deep similarities here? So, I picked that three of these are deep similarities. In both there’s something revolving around something else. The planet revolving around the sun and the electron revolving around the nucleus. In both, there’s a force between two objects. A force between the sun and the planet, and a force between a nucleus and an electron. And in both, two objects at- tract each other. All three of these are based on relationships. The revolution, the force between two objects and the attraction between two objects. I didn’t pick the other three because while these two are true, they don’t represent deep relationships. And while this is actually true, it’s not actually captured in our representation. So this isn’t part of our knowledge base for the purpose of this problem. Now we can see why the textbooks write about this solar system and the atomic structure in such a way that these relationships become salient. They help us make sense of the atomic structure, but pointing to the deep similarities between the relationship that are occurring with the atomic structure and the relationship that are occurring in the solar system.
