What choices did you pick David? So there’s a few different ways we can do the mapping be- tween the sun, the planet on the left and the nucleus and the electron on the right. If we look only at the top half of each representation all we can really say is that the sun must map to one of them and the planet must map to one of them. Because these relationships are symmetrical, if I don’t consider the bottom half it wouldn’t matter which is which. If I look at the bottom half of the representations however, it tells me which part of the Solar System must correspond to which part of the Atomic Structure. The planet revolves around the Sun, and the electron revolves around the nucleus. So the planet and the electron must correspond because both are doing the revolving and the Sun and the nucleus must correspond because they are the centers of the revolution. So, the sun corresponds to the nucleus and the planet corresponds to the electron. This is right, David. Another thing to take away from here is, look at the depth of understanding it requires in order to be able to make the right kind of correspondences. If one did not have the right kind of model for the solar system and atomic structure that captures the deep relationships, then the mapping may not be done and the alignment wouldn’t work. And we would not be able to understand the atomic structure in terms of the solar system. This models deep and rich models of the two systems, the target problem and the source case are essential to deciding how to align them, how to map them, and as we will see in a moment, what to transfer and how to transfer it.
