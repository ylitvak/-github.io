What do you think, David? So perhaps un- surprisingly, I said that the two most similar situations in my original answer were both deeply and superficially similar. A woman climbing a step ladder is both deeply similar in that the relationship are the same. And superficially similar in that the woman and the ladder are somewhat similar. I also said that the woman climbing a set of stairs is both deep and superficially similar. We still have a woman climbing in both, and I said that a set of stairs is somewhat superficially similar to a ladder, in that both are designed to allow someone to ascend. Although some others might say that that’s not superficially similar. Then I said that the other three that involved rising in some way were all deeply similar as well. The plane taking off into the sky, the woman climbing the corporate ladder, and the ant walking up the wall were all deeply similar to me because all involved this relation- ship of climbing. I said that the woman painting a ladder was only superficially similar, which is why it was one of the lowest rated in our original exercise. And finally the water bottle sitting on a desk is neither deeply similar nor superficially similar, because nothing is the same be- tween those two situations. This is good, David. Once again, different people may give different answers to this exercise. Why did we do so? Well, let’s examine it next.
