|Exercise Concept Learning Revisited 2| 
David what did you think and tell us also why you chose the answers that
you did. So I said that these five were all birds, each of them have
wings, each of them have feathers, and I know that each of them lay
eggs. The other three are kind of interesting. This is a sugar glider,
and it flies, and we often think of flying as a bird behavior, but it
doesn’t fly the same way birds do, and it doesn’t have the other
features that birds have. It has fur instead of feathers and doesn’t
actually have wings and we also know it doesn’t lay eggs. A bat is even
more interesting. A bat does have wings, but it doesn’t have feathers
the way birds do and bats actually give birth to live young. The
platypus shown here is an interesting case because it actually lays
eggs, it has a bill like a bird does, and it also has flippers the way a
duck does. But it’s still not a bird because it doesn’t have feathers.
So I would say that these five are all our birds. Some of the things
that we often attribute to birds like flying, the blue bird, and the
eagle, and the duck do. Penguins and ostriches don’t actually do, but
they’re still birds because they meet our other criteria for birds. That
was a good answer, David, thank you. Note that David was able to
classify these eight animals into birds, which one of these animals
belong to the class of birds and which did not belong to it? Notice also
that he used some criteria to decide on that. He has some notion it
seems of what is a typical bird, what kind of features does a typical
bird have. Here’s some notion of what are the basic conditions that
something must satisfy in order to be considered a bird. And if those
conditions are not being satisfied, he would reject them and say those
are not birds.
