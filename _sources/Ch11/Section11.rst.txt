|Exercise Concept Hierarchies 1| 
What do you think, David? So what I did, is I looked across the rows and
tried to see which features all three birds had in common. They all lay
eggs, so I’m going to figure that birds law eggs. They all have wings,
so I’ going to figure that birds have wings. And none of them have fur,
so I’m going to figure that birds don’t have fur. Whether or not they
have talons can actually vary. So the eagle and bluebird have talons but
the penguin does not. And whether or not they are large can vary. The
eagle and penguin are large, but the bluebird’s not. So those things
don’t necessarily define what a bird is. But these three things seem to
me like they do. That’s a good answer, David. But I should quickly note
that this idea that we can decide on the features that should go into a
super class, given the features that are shared among these subclasses,
works only for certain kind of concept. It doesn’t work for all
concepts. Particularly, it work for concepts that have a formal nature,
as we will see in just a minute.
