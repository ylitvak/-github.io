|Types of Concepts| 
We can think of concepts lying on a spectrum. On one extreme end are
extremely formal concepts for which we can define logical conditions
that are necessary and sufficient for that concept. We’ll examine that
in more detail in just a minute. On the other end of the spectrum are
less formal concepts for which it’s hard to define necessary and
sufficient conditions. Now here are three points on the spectrum.
Axiomatic concepts, prototype concepts, exemplar concepts. There can be
other types of concepts as well. We’re just going to consider these
three concepts because they are the three most common ones. And we’ll
look at each one of them in turn. In general, humans find it easier to
communicate about axiomatic concepts because they are well defined.
There is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that we all agree
with. Examples are mathematical concepts. Humans find it harder to
communicate about prototype concepts, but most of the time we do quite
well. It’s even harder to talk about exemplar concepts like, let’s say,
beauty or freedom. Similarly, it’s easier to teach computers axiomatic
concepts or program axiomatic concepts into computers. It’s much harder
to program or teach prototype concepts. And much, much harder to teach a
program exemplar type concepts.
