|Concept Hierarchies 1| 
So, I just talked about the organization of concepts and the
relationship of concepts with each other. We only come across this when
we were talking about background knowledge in the previous lesson on
incremental concept learning. So we had a brick and a wedge. They were
both subclasses of a block. In general, the organization of concepts can
be much more complex. So here is a set of concepts that you’re probably
all familiar with. We have different kind of animals, vertebrates,
intervertebrates. Vertebrates themselves, can be of different kinds,
reptiles, birds, mammals, and so on. And here are birds, which can be of
different kinds, eagles, bluebirds, and penguins, like we saw in the
previous slide. And generally, organization of these concepts can be a
little more complicated. So this is a conceptual hierarchy that I expect
all of your family with the animals of various kinds, water breeds and
in water breeds, for example. And vertebrates themselves can be a
different reptiles, but mammals and birds can be a different kinds, for
example, eagles, bluebirds and penguins. So these are classes, and these
are sub-classes and super classes. Now the advantage of this kind of
conceptual organization is that I can start going in a top down way
establishing and refining each category. So you see an animal and you’re
trying to decide whether the animal is a bluebird or an eagle or a
penguin. And you may start, initially, by saying well, is it a
vertebrate? Then, is it a bird? And if it is a bird, then is it a eagle,
a bluebird, or penguin? When you and I do processing of this kind, it
might happen so fast that we might not be aware of it. But, when we try
to put an air-agent, we have to make that processing very, very
explicit. Even among humans, imagine for example, what happens when the
scientist discovers new kind of species. Then the scientist can begin
from the top and say, well, is it a vertebrate? Where exactly in this
tree should I put this species? Is it a bird? Is it closer to eagle?
Should I put it closer to a bluebird, and so on. So classification of
this kind often has a top down, establish, refine, establish, refine
connected to it. So one of the benefits of this establish and refine
approach is it helps us figure out which variables we need to actually
key in on and focus in on. So for example, we saw earlier that eagles
are large, but bluebirds are small. So birds can come in different
sizes. So if we are trying to establish whether something is a bird, a
reptile, or a mamma, we know that mammals also come in different sizes
like tiny mice or large elephants. So size doesn’t really impact our
decision whether it’s a reptile, bird, or mammal. But once we’ve
established it’s a bird, and we’re trying to decide between eagle and
bluebird for example, we know that size actually can be something that
helps us differentiate between to these two. So now we’ll pay attention
to size as a variable that matters. So note that there are several
things going on here. On one side, there is knowledge of these different
classes, but there’s also organization of these different classes in a
hierarchical particular kind. This organization is very powerful in some
ways. If knowledge is power, so is organization. Organization too is
power. This organization provides power, because this organization tells
you what the controller processing should be. Establish one node, refine
it. Establish that node, refine it.
