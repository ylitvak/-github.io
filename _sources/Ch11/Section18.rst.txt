|Exercise Order of Concepts 1| 
So part of the point of looking at these two different kinds of concepts
is that depending on the different kinds of concepts we are dealing with
right now, you may come up with a different knowledge representation and
a different inference method. Let me explain. Supposing we’re dealing
with concepts like Foo or Holiday or Inspirational. Then the case-based
reasoning method might be a very good method for dealing with things of
that kind. We may have experience with specific holidays, but we cannot
abstract them out into a concept with prototypical conditions. On the
other hand, if we were dealing with concepts like a right triangle or a
reptile, for which we can define necessary and sufficient conditions, in
that case there are alternative methods available that might be more
suitable then case-based reasoning. So instead of thinking in terms of
one method that is going to work for all conditions and all concepts, we
might want to think in terms of a array of methods, where each method is
more or less useful for different kind of conditions or different kind
of concepts. David, I am sure you recall mentally who was a Russian
chemist who came up with the basic notion of the chemical periodic
table. I’m sure all the students in the class know about the chemical
periodic table, which organizes all the elements according to certain
properties like hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, and so on. Now, Mendeleev
came up with this notion of a chemical periodic table, and in some sense
what we’re trying to do in this course is to build a similar kind of
periodic table, except that this is a periodic table of the elements of
mind. It’s a periodic table of the basic fundamental elements that
compose intelligence. Instead of talking about elements and valances and
atoms and so on, what we are going to be talking about are methods and
representations. So it as if we are discovering the fundamental
knowledge for presentations and organizations and reasoning methods that
go with it. Case based reasoning was one. Reasoning method that went
with certain kinds of concepts that are hard to abstract and into
conditions, like typical conditions, are necessarily logical conditions.
