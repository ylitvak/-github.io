Let us build on this metaphor of periodic table a little bit further. So
earlier we came across another method of dealing with classification,
which we call top down or establish define. In that method we had this
classification hierarchy which start with a concept, will establish it,
then refine it, and refine it further if needed. That particular control
of processing is very well suited for one kind of organization of
concepts. It’s very well suited for one set of situations where we know
something is already a vertebrate, we’re trying to establish whether
it’s a bird or a bluebird. And a different kind of classification task.
A better control of processing is to go bottom up. Let’s look at this a
little bit more carefully. Here are a number of leaf nodes. And we know,
the agent knows something about the value for each of these leaf nodes.
And the task is to make a prediction at the root node. So in this
particular case imagine the task of the AA agent is to predict the of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average tomorrow. It’ll be great to have an AA
agent like that. If we had a good AA agent like that, you and I could
both become very rich. Now how could this A, agent make a prediction
about the Dow Jones Industrial Average tomorrow? Well, one way in which
it could do it is it could look at the. Information it has about the GDP
the inflation and employment today. but how does it know about the value
GDP or the inflation or employment today. Well it can look then at the
values of the overtime hours. The consumer sentiment index, new orders
index and so on and so forth. Now, the processing is largely, bottom up.
We know something about the values or the features that go into this
concept. And they’re going to this concept, they’re going to this
concept. You can abstract them and find the value of the GDP. And
similarly for this, and then abstract it further. So the control of
processing in this particular case, we might call it identify and
abstract, identify an abstract. Bottom-up controller processing rather
than top-down in the previous case. We have just defined two other
elements of our periodic table, of our growing periodic table of
intelligence. In this latter element, the bottom-up classification, the
conditions of application are different.
