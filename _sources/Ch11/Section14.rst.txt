The notion of axiomatic concepts is the classical view in cognitive
systems. Here’s an alternative view. This is called Prototypical
concepts. Prototypical concept is a base concepts defined by some
typical properties that can sometimes be overridden. So, an example is a
chair. You and I have a notion of a prototypical chair. Our notion of a
prototypical chair may have, for example, there is a back, there is four
legs and so on. So, here might be your and my notion of a prototypical
chair. It has a back, it has a seat, it has four legs and so on. Now I
can represent this notion of the prototypical chair in the language of
frames. This is something we have come across earlier in the class. A
frame has slots and fillers, as you may recall, and we use frames to
represent stereotypes. Here we’re talking about prototypes, so very
closely related. So concept is the a content you can represent. Frame is
the form in which we can represent it. So a notion for the prototypical
chair might be, it has four legs, it, the material is metal, it has a
back, it does not have arms, and it’s not cushioned. Note that these are
the typical properties of a chair. Of course, some chairs need not
necessarily satisfy all of these properties. That is why there are no,
no necessary and sufficient conditions here. For example, we may come
across a chair. Which is made of wood. While you would still consider it
a chair, even if you’re not strictly satisfied with this particular
definition. Thus, these properties can be overridden in case of specific
instances. But we’ll still have the basic notion of a prototypical chair
so that we can in fact communicate with each other about what a chair
is. Despite the fact that we can override these properties we do still
have a notion of prototypical chair. So the relationships between
concepts and frames actually is quite close. Recall that when we were
talking about frames, we were also talking about inheritance and
default. The notion of default in frames is closely connected to the
notion of typical properties and concepts. So chair has this
prototypical notion with some of these typical properties, and we can
think of this as having a default values. By default, we assume the
number of legs is four, the material is metal and so on. Here is a stool
and this stool is a kind of chair which means that it inherits all the
values and all the slots that are there in the chair directly except for
those that happen to be different from the one in the chair. So then an
example here it over writes a notion that the chair necessarily has to
have a back. In the case of a stool, the stool does not have a back.
