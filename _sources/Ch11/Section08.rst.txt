|Exercise Equivalence Classes 1| 
David, do you know about these three animals? Were you able to answer
this question? So, admittedly, I used Wikipedia a little bit to find out
some of these answers, but we know that eagles lay eggs, bluebirds lay
eggs, penguins. They all lay eggs, and they all have wings. Eagles and
bluebirds have talons, whereas penguins kind of more have flippers
because they swim, so they don’t really have talons. All right. Eagles
and bluebirds also fly, whereas penguins don’t fly. None of them have
fur and we might say that eagles and penguins are large whereas
bluebirds are not very large. Our definition of large is kind of
variable, it’s kind of subjective, but if we were to draw lines
somewhere, it’s reasonable to say that bluebird is definitely on the
smaller end of the spectrum. Good David, you know more about those
animals than I do. Imagine that the three animals were given as
examples, one after the other. So, we are back to incremental concept
learning of the previous lesson. One can use the techniques that we
learned in the previous lesson to learn some equivalence class, learn
some concept definition with the three animals. But that’s not the point
here, the point here is not about the learning of the concept, the point
here is much more about the nature of the concepts and how they get
organized related to each other
