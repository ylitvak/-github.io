There’re several ways of how we can deal with visuospatial knowledge. In
fact in your projects you’ve already come across some of them. So
imagine there is a figure here. Here is a triangle with the apex facing
to the right. Here is another triangle with the apex facing to the left.
So in one view, the AI agent can extract propositional representations
out of figures like this. And similarly propositional representations
out of figures like this. So this is a propositional representation,
this is a propositional representation. And then, the AI agent can work
on these propositional representations to produce new propositional
representations. So some AI agent can use a logic engine or a production
rule to say that this particular triangle, which was rotated 90 degrees,
has not been rotated to 270 degrees. So although the input wasn’t in
formula’s figures, the action here was at the level of propositional
representations of these figures. The agent may extract propositional
representations like this through image processing, through image
segmentation, perhaps using some techniques like constraint propagation
as well. Alternatively, the agent may have analogical representations.
In these analogical representations, it is a structural correspondence
between the representation and the external figure. So the external
world headed triangle like this, and the analogical representation will
also have a triangle like this. Notice that I’m using the term
Analogical Representation, we use a separate thing from analogical
reasoning. We are not talking about analogical reasoning right now.
We’re talking about analogical representation and analogical
representation is one, which is some structural correspondence with the
external world that is being represented. Give a certain analogical
representation, then I might want affine transformations or set
transformations to get this. So I may say that I got this triangle out
of that one, simply by the operation of reflection or rotation. So these
proposed representations in the previous view are A model. They are
separated from, divorced from the perceptual modality. These analogical
representations on the other hand, are modal representations. They’re
very close to the perceptual modality. And human cognition, mental
imagery, appears to use analogical representations. What would be an
equally intuitive of computational imagery? Human cognition is very good
at using both propositional representations and analogical
representations. Computers however, are not yet good at using analogical
representations. Most computers, most of the time, use only
prepositional presentations. The same kind of analysis may apply to
other perceptual modalities, not just to our visual images. So here are
two measures and we can either extract proposed representations out of
them and then analyze those propositional representations. Or, we could
think directly with the relationship in these two particular measures.
There is a question for building queries of human cognition. When you’re
driving a car, and you listen to a melody on your radio and you’re
reminded of something. Reminded of a similar melody that you had heard
earlier. What exactly is happening? Are you extracting a purpose for
your presentation out of the melody that you just heard? And then the
proposition representation reminds you of the proposition representation
for a previously heard melody. Or, does a new melody somehow directly
remind you of a previously heard melody without any intermediate
propositional representation? These are our open issues in cognitive
science, as well as in knowledge based AI. In cognitive science, it is
by now, significant agreement that human cognition does use mental
imagery at least with visual images. But we don’t know how to do mental
imagery in computers.
