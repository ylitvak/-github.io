|Defining Creativity II| 

Good question, David. Novelty had use with newness, the unexpectedness
had use with something non-obvious or surprising. Perhaps this will
become clearer if I take an example. So in my deal, we decide to
entertain a group of 20 friends. We already know how to make soufflés
according to a particular recipe. We’ll make soufflé for 20 friends this
time. We have never made soufflé for 20 people, so something is novel,
something new, something we haven’t done earlier. On the other hand, we
have known this recipe for ages. Something unexpected would be if we
come up with a new recipe for this soufflé which taste dramatically
different, surprisingly different. Not just something new, but something
unexpected. So far we have been talking about the product of creativity,
the result of creativity, the outcome of creativity. What about the
process of creativity? You use it on here some and other, both of these
terms are important. Let’s first look at the term other. In this course
we’ve only talked about several processes of creativity. An analogical
reasoning is a fundamental process of creativity. You already explored
an analogical reasoning in the context of designing. We just did that
when were talking about design thinking. One might be able to design a
new kind of water pump, but composing several water pumps in series if
one can analogically transfer a design factor from the domain of
electrical circuits. Was a very good example. Similarly under analogical
reasoning, we were talking about the processes that might be used to
come up with a model the atomic structure the analogy to the model the
solar system, which clearly is a creative process that cuts across large
number dimensions of space and time. Another place where we talked about
creative processes was when we were talking about explanation based
learning. It seems creative, if the robot can go to the kitchen, and use
the flower pot as a cup to bring you coffee. Here are three other
processes of creativity. Emergence, re-representation, and serendipity.
A simple example of emergences. If I draw three lines. One, two, three.
Then a triangle emerges out of it. The triangleness doesn’t belong to
any single line. I was not even trying to draw a triangle. I just drew
three lines, and a triangle emerged out of it. Emergence of the triangle
to the drawing the three lines is a kind of creativity.
Re-representation occurs when the original representation of the problem
is not conducive to problem solving. So we re-represent the problem and
then commence problem solving. To see an example of this. Let’s go back
to atomic structure and solve this problem. Suppose that we have a model
sort of system which uses the word the planets revolve around the sun.
You also have a model of the atom, and this uses the term the electron
rotates around the nucleus. The model of the sun had the word revolve.
The model of the atom has the word rotates. The two vocabularies are
different. If you were to stay with, with this couple of sort of
presentations mapping between rotate and reward would be very hard. On
the hand, suppose we were to re-represent this problem. Re-represent the
atomic structure by growing the nucleus in the middle and the electron
around it. We represent the solar system by drawing the sun in the
middle and the earth around it. Then in this new representation, we can
see the similarity, we can do the mock-up. This re-representation is
another fundamental process of creativity. Serendipity can be of many
types and can occur in many different situations. One kind of
serendipity occurs when I’m trying to address a problem but I’m unable
to address it. So I suspend the goal and I start doing something
different. Later, at some other time, I come across a solution, and I
connect it with the previous, suspended goal. The story has it that in
1941 in France, Josh Mistral’s wife asked him to help her open a dress
by pulling on a zipper because it was stuck. Mistral struggled with the
zipper, but couldn’t pull it down. Later on one day, Mistral was walking
his dog, when he found that some birds were stuck to the dog’s legs.
Curious about this, Mistral looked at the bird closely under the
microscope, he then connected the solution, the bird solution to the
opening of the zipper problem and out of that was born the notion of
Velcro which you and I now use on a common basis. But just like the word
other was important here, these are three processes in addition to the
process we already discussed in this class. The word some is also
important here. This is not an exhaustive list. There are in fact
additional things we can add. For example, another potential process
here is called conceptual combination.
