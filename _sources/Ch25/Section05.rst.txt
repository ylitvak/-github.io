|Visuospatial Reasoning An Example| 

One air system that does do visual spatial reasoning is called Galatia.
It was developed by Jim Davies here at Georgia Tech, about 10 years
back. Which is why it looks black and white and has this particular
form. We provide a reference to the paper and in notes. There is a very
famous problem and a logical reasoning called a Duncke problem. The
Duncke problem goes something like this. First I’ll tell you a story.
And then I’ll give you a problem. And you should try to find an answer
to the problem. Let me begin with the story. Once there was a king and
not a specially good king who ruled a kingdom. There was an army. That
was trying to overthrow the king. But the king lived in a fortress and
it was very hard to overthrow. Moreover, the king had mined the roads,
so that when the army went over the roads, it would blow off, and most
of the soldiers in the army would die. The leader of the army decomposed
the army into smaller groups, and these smaller groups then came to the
fortress from different directions. Because each group is small enough,
the mines did not blow off and each group was able to reach the fortress
at the same time. They are able to overthrow the bad king. This was a
story, now let me tell you about the problem. There is a patient with a
cancer tumor in his body. There is a physician with a laser gun. She can
use the laser gun on this tumor to kill this tumor and cure the patient.
However, the laser light is so strong that it will also kill all the
healthy tissue in the way, and the patient can die. What should the
physician do? In most computer models of this problem, this problem is
solved using propositional representations. So an example for proper
surplus reduction for the original story might be that if there is a
goal, and there is a resource, there is an obstacle between the resource
and the goal that split the resource into many different smaller
resources and bring them to the goal all at the same time but from
different directions. Most composition models or decomposition problem
extract some causal pattern. The causal pattern might be that if there
is a goal and there is a resourcable level, and your resource can
achieve the goal but there is an obstacle in the way. Then decompose the
resourcing to many smaller resources and bring them to the goal in the
same time from different directions. The important part here is that
this is the causal pattern extracted out of the first story. Once this
causal pattern has been extracted, it can be applied to this new
problem. So the physician may decompose the laser being into smaller
beams and focus them on the tumor at the same time, thus curing the
tumour. Jim wanted to ask whether one could do the same kind of problem
solving without extracting these causal patterns. Could one use simply
visual spatial knowledge? So this is visual spatial knowledge because
there is both a sense of what, the fortress, as well as where, in the
middle of the figure. Notice there is visual spatial knowledge is
represented prepositionally. There are words here like fortress, and
right road, and top road, and so on. But there is no causality that is
explicit. You and I can infer the causality but it’s not explicit. His
Galatea program was able to find a solution to the new problem by
transporting the visual spatial knowledge to the new problem, one step
at a time. Thus it would map this top body part to the top rod. One
here, the left body part, the left rod here, and therefore beside that,
this can be decomposed. This resources, denoted by this arrow, can be
decomposed into smaller resources. And then the smaller resources can
arrive at this central tumor from different directions at the same time.
In this way, Galatea was able to solve the addition problem without
abstracting any causal pattern from it. Of course, one might say that
the causal pattern is implicit here, and that is indeed true. But the
entire point of a visual spatial knowledge here is that the causal
pattern is not being obstructed, but as long as it is a problem-solving
procedure where each step is represented only visually spatially. It is
possible to transfer this problem-solving proceeded to the new crop.
