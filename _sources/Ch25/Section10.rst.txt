So AI has drawn up representations that help capture both divisible
levels of obstruction structure for example. And the indivisible levels
like behavior and function. Therefore these models are sometimes called
structure, behavior, function. Let’s take a simple example. All of us
are familiar with the household flashlight. You press on the button and
light comes out of the bulb. What you can see is, the button and the
bulb and the body of the flashlight. You can even open the body of the
flashlight and you might see some batteries inside your flashlight.
That’s all you can see. But of course there is more going on here. To
begin with, this particular flashlight has a function. This function is
invisible. You can ascribe to it, but it’s nowhere inside the body of
the bulb. One level at which it is used would analyze the flashlight is,
to ask ourselves what does it do. Not yet, how does it work? Just what
does it do, its function. Here is a representation of the function. Here
is the function, create light off that light bulb circuit, or the
flashlight light bulb circuit. There is some stimulus, some external
force on the switch. Initially there was no light, zero lumens and
finally there is some light, 30 lumens. This captures the notion that
when I press on the switch, light comes out. Here is a presentation of
the structure of the flashlight. Here is a light bulb, the switch, and
the battery. And they’re connected. All of them are attached. Here is
the invisible causal process that we’re calling behaviour. We’ll capture
this behavior through a series of states and transitions between these
states. So here is electricity initially in the battery. Then this
electricity flows from the battery to the bulb, and then the bulb
converts this electricity into light. But in order for this electricity
to flow to the bulb, this particular switch has to be in the mode ON.
The switch goes into the mode ON, when someone presses on it.
Electricity is converted to light, because that’s the function of the
bulb. Notice that these SBF models are nested. We just gave an SBF model
of the flashlight circuit. But now if you want, we can do the SBF model
of the lightbulb itself. How does it create light? In this way,
structure behavior function models capture not just the visible
structure, but also the invisible cause of processes, the behaviors and
the functions. Moreoever, they capture the multiple abstraction, at the
level of the flashlight, at the level of the bulb, and so on. We’ll not
describe it in detail here, the structure behavior function models and
other similar models enables systems thinking in the context of
diagnosis and design of complex systems. You’re provided some readings
about this in the course materials, if you want to read more about it.
