|Systems Thinking Connections 1| 


We can connect the subject’s thinking to several topics we have already
covered in this class. You may recall that early on in this course, we
used frames to understand stories of this kind. Now this story is
actually capturing some information about a system. In this political
system, there is a country with people and a president. It also had
geological faults as a result of which earthquakes occur that killed
some people. So the components, the complex relationships between these
components, the complex processes that emerge out of this interaction
between the components. Scripts, too, are related to system thinking.
Dining at a restaurant is a complex system. Once again, there are a
number of components, relationships, interactions, processes, functions.
A script is a knowledge for presentation that allows us to capture
knowledge of a stereotypical dining experience at a restaurant. When we
discussed diagnosis, at that time we talked about systems thinking a
little bit more explicitly. To begin with, we said that diagnosis is
identification of a fault responsible for a malfunctioning system.
Diagnosis begins with the observed data about some system what are its
expectations of the behavior expected of it. The diagnostic paths takes
the data and matches it to hypotheses of a fault responsible for that
behavior. What makes a diagnostic task so hard, again, is that there are
a large number of components that interact with each other, and it is a
complex behavior that emerges out of the interaction between these
components. Just think of program debugging. Program debugging is hard
because there are a large number of lines in the code, and these lines
in the code interact with each other, and very complex behaviors, output
behaviors, emerge because of those interactions. So another good example
of how diagnosis is a case of systems thinking is if we look at
ecological systems. Recently there’s been a massive drop in the
population of bees around the world. That’s our data. As it turns out,
the cause for this drop in bee population is the presence of a poisonous
substance in insecticides used in the past several years. However, we
can’t see the process of bees getting poisoned by this chemical. All we
can do is infer it based on higher level interactions of seeing the bee
populations drop and seeing a rise in this chemical. So, in this way,
there’s multiple levels of abstraction in this process. There’s the
visible bee population, there’s the visible use of pesticide, but
there’s also an invisible layer where the pesticide actually poisons the
bees. So, we have to discern the interaction between these multiple
levels. In any complex system there will be many levels of abstraction,
some invisible, some visible. The human eye, or human senses more
generally, can see only some of these levels of abstraction, the visible
levels of abstraction. System thinking helps us understand the invisible
levels.
