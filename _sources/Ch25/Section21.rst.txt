|AI Ethics| 

Finally, the last topic we’ll cover in this class is AI ethics. Often,
scientists go about doing science without asking questions about the
ethics of the science they do. We are also engrossed in questions of
funding and proposals and papers. However, part of our job as scientists
is to ask the question about are we doing the right kind of things?
There are a large number of questions connected with the ethics of AI.
We’ll post a small number here today. There are no easy answers to these
questions. So I invite you to discuss these questions on the forum?
First, AI Ethics put into our economy and our society. We have talked a
lot in this course about designing AI agent that can act and think and
behave like humans. However, in the process, we quite likely would
replace some human jobs with robots. We have talked, for example, of
robots that can assemble a camera. Does this mean that humans who
assemble the cameras today will lose their jobs? Of course, a counter
argument is that new jobs might be created, for example, jobs for
designing robots. Nevertheless, there are hard issues, but ethical
implications of AI in terms of human economy and society. Second, much
of the modern development of AI is driven by defense applications all
across the world. We already have drones, for example. It is not
far-fetched to imagine a future where there are robot soldiers on the
battlefield. What are the implications of introducing robot soldiers?
Should we build morality into these soldiers? How do we do so? And if
you are to build morality into robot, what does it teach us about our
own morality? A third and related question is, that if it’s hard
building human characteristics like creativity and morality into AI
agents, at what point do these agents become like humans? At what point
do we start talking about civil rights for these machines because
they’re indistinguishable from humans. The idea has been touched upon in
the popular culture a lot, but it is coming closer and closer to
reality. What are the criteria under which we’d consider machines to be
equal to humans?
