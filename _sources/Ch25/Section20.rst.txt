|Exercise Defining Creativity IV 1| 

But let’s look at each of these choices, one at a time. The first one
says yes, because in order for a result to be creative, it must be
novel, an output of an algorithm cannot be novel. Well, there are a few
problems with this particular answer. What if an output of an algorithm
for a small, closed-word problem cannot be novel? The output of
combinations of algorithms for open ended problem can and indeed
sometimes is novel. There are algorithms for example, that do design or
that do scientific discovery, whose results are novel. Let’s look at the
second answer. Yes, because given a set of input, the output will always
be the same. Therefore, the product can never be unexpected. The output
will depend not just on the input. And not only on the methods of the
system, but also the situation in which the methods are situated. The
output depends not just on the input under the method the AI agent uses,
but also the context in which the AI agent is situated. For example,
given the same input but different context or the input, the agent will
come up with very different outputs, very different understandings of
that same input as we saw in this section on understanding. The third
answer, no because it defines creativity in terms of the output rather
than the process. This answer too has problems, because sometimes
creativity can be defined simply in terms of the output without knowing
anything about the process. We can think of a black box, that creates
very interesting creative music. We would not know anything about the
process that it is using. But, if the output’s interesting and creative
music, we would consider it to be creative. Personally, my sympathies
lie with the fourth answer. But, of course you are welcome to disagree
with me. Why don’t we continue this discussion on the forum?
