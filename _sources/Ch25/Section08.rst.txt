|Systems Thinking Introduction 1| 

In this class we have talked a lot about how AI agents must be able to
reason about the work. But the external work consists of systems from
many different kinds. A system is composed of heterogeneous interacting
components. The interaction within components, lead to processes of
different kinds. These processes can occur at many different of those
abstraction. Some of the processes might be invisible. Consider an
ecosystem. In an ecosystem, processes occur at many levels of
abstraction. Physical, biological, chemical. Some of these processes are
invisible to the naked eye, but they influence each other. Similarly in
business, businesses are composed of a large number of interacting
units, manufacturing, marketing, delivery, and so on. Each of these
units can be described at many levels of abstraction, from individuals,
to teams, to full organizations. Given that the extra work consists of
systems of different kinds. Their agents must be capable of systems
thinking. They must be capable of thinking about the invisible
properties of systems. About the complex behavior of the systems. In
particular, they must be able to derive the invisible processes from the
visible structure. This is systems thinking.
