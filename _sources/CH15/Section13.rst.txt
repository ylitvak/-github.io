Nevertheless, let us continue and see how else this theory enables common sense reasoning. So consider the sentence, Ashok enjoy eating the frog. So not just Ashok ate the frog, Ashok enjoyed it. How do we make sense of this term? Once again, because the word eat, we may have the primitive action for ingest. Here is Ashok as the agent, frog as the object, and this time we’ll have under the slot called result, which shows what happens when Ashok eats the frog. We will call this frame a state-change frame, where there was some initial state and some state at the end of this particular action, the action of ingest. So, here there is Ashok’s mood, which is becoming happy. So Ashok, how would the agent know that in this case, the verb we’re going to key on first is eating instead of enjoyed? Good point, David. So we can imagine a different action frame for feel because of enjoy being a feel. The agent as Ashok. Ashok is the one holding the feeling, and the object, or the feeling that is being felt, is joy. We can still have a frame for eating, and we can relate those two frames. So what specific interpretation an agent will make this particular sentence will depend on the precise rules that we’re going to put into this slot so that the agent can make either this interpretation or that interpretation. We’ll see another example of this situation in just a minute.
