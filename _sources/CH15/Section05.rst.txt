There are sort of several other things to note here. What is the last sentence that has two verbs in it? Decided and go. Youâ€™ll see in a minute, how we can deal with sentences or stories that have multiple verbs in them. Second, you are right in that it is not always very easy to decide which is the best primitive action for capturing the meaning of a particular verb here. So the verb here was pushed, and the reason David propelled or moved object is because in propulsion the body is in some sense in contact with the particular object that is getting moved. Now we are not sure inherently detailed specification of each of one of these primitive actions. But I can tell you that the readings at the end do give them in detail.
