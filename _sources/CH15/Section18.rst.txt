So would you use commonsense reasoning to design an agent that could answer Raven’s progressive matrices? Here you might make two connections. First you could connect primitive actions of agents, to primitive transformations in these matrices. Different problems could be com- posed out of a finite set of possible transformations. What would those primitive transformations be? And what would the action frames involved in each transformation look like? Second, you might connect those individual primitive actions to higher level transformations. What would your primitive transformations be? And what common higher level transformations are possible? What primitive actions would result in those higher level transformations? And how would composing these like this, actually help you solve Raven’s progressive matrices? In a way that you couldn’t do otherwise?
