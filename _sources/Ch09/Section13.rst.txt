But for now, let's go back to where, original navigation micro world. Imagine that we have a nucleus Y. Given our index equals scheme here, of X were coordinates of the initial location, what do you think of the indices of the case Y?

.. fillintheblank:: Ch09Ex2

    .. blank:: X
        :correct: \\b(1e|1E)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "X is incorrect. Check and make sure you're looking at the origin for route Y, and that you're looking at the right axis for each coordinate.")

        What indices should be used for case Z? X:

    .. blank:: Y
        :correct: \\b(9n|9N)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "Y is incorrect. Check and make sure you're looking at the origin for route Y, and that you're looking at the right axis for each coordinate.")

        Y:
