Let's consider a different case. Supposing we have a case Z of going back from the restaurant or the home. Let's also suppose that we're change our index equal Kim. Now we are indexing things by the x square coordinates of the destination not the origin. What will be the indices for the case Z?

.. fillintheblank:: Ch09Ex3

    .. blank:: X
        :correct: \\b(1e|1E)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "X is incorrect. Check and make sure you're looking at the origin for route Z, and that you're looking at the right axis for each coordinate.")

        What indices should be used for case Z? X:

    .. blank:: Y
        :correct: \\b(9n|9N)\\b
        :feedback1: (".*", "Y is incorrect. Check and make sure you're looking at the origin for route Z, and that you're looking at the right axis for each coordinate.")
