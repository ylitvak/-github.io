In this assignment, discuss how you'd use case-based reasoning to develop an agent that can answer Raven's Progressive Matrices. Make sure to describe how this is different from learning by recording cases alone. Where is your adaptation phase? How are you adapting past solutions to the new problem? What is evaluation in this context? How are you evaluating the strength of your answer? Are you going to record the cases that your agent encounters as they're solving the test, or are you going to equip them with past cases beforehand for them to use to solve new problems?
