*There are three basic approaches to AI: Case-based, rule-based, and Connectionist reasoning.
-- Marvin Minsky*

*A few observations and much reasoning lead to error; many observations and a little reasoning to truth.

Today we will talk about Case-Based Reasoning. In Case-based reasoning, the cognitive agent addresses new problems by tweaking solutions to similar previously encountered problems. Case-based reasoning builds on the previous lesson on learning recording cases. In learning recording cases, the new problem is identical to the previous problem. In case-based reasoning, the new problem is similar to a previously encountered problem. Case-based reasoning typically has several phases, case retrieval, case adaptation, case evaluation, and case storage. We'll also discuss certain advanced processes of case-based reasoning which will include new methods for case retrieval.
