Now that we have considered storage, let's revisit retrieval. We talked about two different ways of organizing the case memory, a tabular way and a discrimination tree. How can we retrieve the case relevant to a given problem? We assume here that the new problem has the same features in its description as the cases stored in the memory. Earlier when we were storing a case in memory, at that time we were navigating this tree to find where in this tree should we store the new case. This time, we'll use the problem to navigate this tree and find out which case is most similar to the problem.
