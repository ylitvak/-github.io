To illustrate the difference between case-based reasoning and learning by recording cases, or instance-based learning, let's revisit our micro-world of blocks. Once again, you can see all of these blocks in this micro-world. So you can see the colors, you can see the shapes, and you could even touch them, so you have some idea about their approximate sizes. Now let us suppose I give you a new block. Note that this new block, the size, is very different from the size of any of the other blocks. What color do you think this block will be?

.. mchoice:: Ch09Ex1
   :answer_a: Green
   :answer_b: Orange
   :answer_c: Blue
   :answer_d: None
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The green block isn't very close in size to the new block at all. Then again, neither are any of the others. What do you do when you can't use the solution to a prior case directly? That's the problem here, and that's the entire goal of case-based reasoning: with recording cases alone, we aren't equipped to address this problem very well.
   :feedback_b: You're right that the orange rectangle is the closest in size, but it's not really very close at all. What do you do when you can't use the solution to a prior case directly? That's the problem here, and that's the entire goal of case-based reasoning: with recording cases alone, we aren't equipped to address this problem very well.
   :feedback_c: The blue block is closest when turned on its side, but it's still not very close. What do you do when you can't use the solution to a prior case directly? That's the problem here, and that's the entire goal of case-based reasoning: with recording cases alone, we aren't equipped to address this problem very well.
   :feedback_d: You're right in general: right now, we would likely assume the color of this rectangle isn't the same as any of the others.

   Which of these is the answer?
