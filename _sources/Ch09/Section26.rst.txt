David what was your answer? So this time we're looking at the origin instead of the destination. We start at the route and ask, is the origin north of 5N? Just barely it is. Is it East of 5E? No, is it east of 3E? No, is it east of 2E? It's really not east of anything. So the case we retrieve is going to be Y. Thatâ€™s right David. Y is the closest matching case to the new problem.
