Let us do an exercise. Supposing we're given the case Y, as shown here. And we're given the discrimination tree, shown on the left. Where would you store the case Y in this discrimination tree?

.. mchoice:: Ch09Ex4
   :answer_a: A
   :answer_b: B
   :answer_c: C
   :answer_d: D
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: That's right! The origin of Y would be North of 5N, not East of 5E, and not East of 3E.
   :feedback_b: To go here, the origin of Y could not be North of 5N. North is to the top of the map; does that match this route's origin?
   :feedback_c: To go here, the origin of Y would have to be East of 5E. East is to the right of the map; does that match this route's origin?
   :feedback_d: To go here, the origin of Y could not be North of 5N. North is to the top of the map; does that match this route's origin?

   Under which branch should case Y be stored?
