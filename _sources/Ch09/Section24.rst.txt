So what was your answer, David? So comparing the X coordinate of the various cases I found that there's two cases that match the X coordinate of the new problem, A and C. Comparing the Y coordinates, though, A is all the way up here, so I would choose C which matches the X and the Y coordinate exactly. That's right, David.
