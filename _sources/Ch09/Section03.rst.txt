And that's the point. The point being that often, the new problem is not identical to the old problem. And when it's not identical, then we have to do some reasoning. We can not just retrieve something from memory, and use the same solution that was used earlier. Case-based reasoning, the phrase case-based reasoning, has two parts to it, case-based, and reasoning. So far we have looked at the case-based part, where we can just extract something from memory and reuse it. Now we can look at the reasoning part. Once you have extracted something off memory, how can you reason about it, and adapt it, but for the new problem?
