But know that A and Y were in this same branch. So we now we need to find a way of discriminating between A and Y. How could we do that?

.. mchoice:: Ch09Ex5
   :answer_a: 1E
   :answer_b: 2E
   :answer_c: 3E
   :answer_d: 4E
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: 1E would work, although it's different from our answer. Because Y is precisely at 1E, it is therefore not East of 1E, and thus splitting at 1E would differentiate A and Y.
   :feedback_b: Route Y starts to the West of 2E while route A starts to the East of 2E, so splitting at 2E would allow us to differentiate these cases.
   :feedback_c: Route A starts exactly on 3E, and therefore is not to the East of 3E. So, 3E isn't a good place to differentiate these cases.
   :feedback_d: Both route Y and route A start to the West of 4E, so 4E is not a good place to differentiate these cases.


   Where should this branch be divided for maximum differentiation?
