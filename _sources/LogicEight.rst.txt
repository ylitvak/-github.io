So this is not conjunctive normal form, because we have a disjunction over conjunction. What we want are either just disjunctions or conjunctions for disjunctions. So use de Morgan’s law to write this in a conjunctive normal form.

What do you have, David? So with the Morgan’s Law, we take the negation on the outside and apply individually to the predicates on the inside, and flip the operator. So has-wings becomes not-has-wings, not-has fur because has-fur. And the and becomes an or.

So imagine that your robot has this in its knowledge base and goes into a country where it finds an animal and from its perspective knows that this animal has wings and does not have fur. So these two additional centers is gotten in the knowledge base. Now the robot wants to prove that this is a bird. In order to [do resolution theorem] proving, what should the robot begin by writing in this box? What should the S4 sentence be?

What do you think, David? So in resolution theorem proving, we always assume the opposite of what we’re trying to prove. We’re doing proof by refutation. So we’re trying to prove that it is a bird, so we’re going to assume that it’s not a bird. That’s right.

Continuing further. So what part of S1 would we eliminate first?
