So let us now see how the AI agent may go about building an explanation. Why this particular object is an instance of this cup? So this what the robot wants to prove, the object is a cup. And this what the robot know about the object. Object has a bottom, the bottom is flat, the object is made of porcelain and so on and so forth. So the question then becomes, how might the AI agent embodied in the robot, go about using its prior knowledge, in order to be able to build this explanation? But another way, what prior knowledge should the AI agent have, so that it can, in fact, build this explanation?
