So imagine that you have gone to the hardware store and bought a robot. This is a household robot. Usually the robot goes into the kitchen, makes coffee and brings it to you in a cup. However, last night you had a big party, and there's no clean cup available in the kitchen. The robot is a creative robot and looks around, and it finds an object. And this object is light and made of porcelain. It has a decoration. It is concave. It has a handle. The bottom is flat. The robot wonders, could I use this particular object like a cup? It would want to prove to itself, that this object, in fact, is an instance of this concept of cup. How might the robot do it?
