To illustrate explanation-based learning, let us begin with an exercise. Imagine that you want to transport soup from the kitchen to the dining table. Unfortunately, all of the usual utensils you use to transport soup are unavailable. They're dirty, or just not there. So you look around, and you see some objects in the vicinity. Here is your backpack, here is a pitcher, here is a box, here is your car. And you wonder which one of these four objects could you use to transport soup from the kitchen to the dining table. Well, which one would you use?
