Okay so now let us see how the AI agent might go about building an explanation that shows that the object that have these properties in fact is an instance of this concept of a cup. What I'll do here is to first sketch out the explanation for you and then I'll discuss how the AI agent goes about building the explanation. Let us first consider this part. This is an abstraction that we learn from the bowl. The object carries liquid because it is concave. There is a similar abstraction learned from the briefcase. The object is liftable because it is light and it has a handle. Here's the abstraction that the air agent learned from the glass. The glass enables drinking because it carries liquids and because it is liftable. So, in this way, the abstraction learned from the glass gets connected to the abstractions learned from the bowl and the abstraction learned from the brief case. Note that the effect here and the abstraction from the bowl has become the cause for the effect that was the abstraction from the glass. Similarly here, the effected object is liftable was learned from the briefcase example, but in the context of the glass, this becomes the cause for object enables drinking. Let's shift to the fourth example for brick. >From there, one knows that the object is stable because it is a bottom and the bottom is flat. Now, we can connect this causal chain and this causal chain into a more complex causal explanation for why this object is a cup. The call that we had said earlier and the definition of a cup, that an object is a cup if, it is stable and it enables drinking, now we have shown that in fact, this particular object is a cup because it is stable and it enables drinking. In practice when an A Agent actually goes about building this explanation, it works backwards. For the definition of the cup, it knows that in order for an object to be a cup, the object must be stable and the object must enable drinking. So the A Agent's senses' goal of proving that the object is stable into his memory. Memory returns the example of a brick, because a brick is stable, but the brick said that the brick is stable because it has a bottom and the bottom is flat. So the air agent affects this causal relationship from the brick example and applies it to the object here. Similarly for this part and they asked for the definition of the cup was that it enables drinking. So how can the A agent prove that the object enables drinking? This object only exists in the kitchen. The air agent sensed the goal of proving that the object enables drinking induced memory. Memory returns the example for glass because the glass enables drinking. It abstracts from glass the fact that the object must carry a liquid and the object must be liftable in order to enable drinking. That sets up some new experiences with sub goals. How can the area agent now prove that the object can carry liquid? That goes back into the memory, and the example of a bowl is found. And I think you can now see how the rest of the explanation process would work. Note this connects with a couple of lessons we have learned earlier. First you can see [INAUDIBLE] reduction and application here. Wanting to prove that object is a cup, to do that we deduce the problem into two smaller and simpler problems. Let's prove that object is stable, let's prove that object enables drinking, and so on and so forth. Second this connects with the notion of planning. When we were discussing planning we had open preconditions. Those were preconditions of a goal which we needed to satisfy. We use those open preconditions to select operators, a similar thing is happening here. When we want to prove that the object is a cup, then we have two open preconditions, object is stable, and object enables drinking. These preconditions then become levels while selecting explanatory proofs, explanatory fragments that can help fulfill those preconditions. So the scenario of a robot proving that an object is a cup is a bit of a longer term scenario. We're still a ways away from having robots that walk around our house and retrieve cups for us. To take an example perhaps from the near future, I can imagine one day having a word processor that has built into it some intelligence such that, instead of choosing a file based strictly on its file name, I can say something like, get me that important document from last Tuesday. I myself might not remember the filename or where I saved it, but I remember that last Tuesday I was working on an important document. The intelligent search in the word processor would then iterate over the documents and say, can I both prove that the document is important and it is from last Tuesday? Now the word processor might not have a notion of importance built into it naturally, but it knows documents I considered important in the past. And it might start to notice the documents that have my header on them, and have my signature at the bottom, are important. And from there, it can start to build a case for why that particular document is important. Coupled with just being able to read the time stamp and see if it's from last Tuesday, it should be able to retrieve for me documents that might be both important and from last Tuesday without me ever really knowing what the document file name was or where I saved it. This kind of explanation-based learning actually occurs in our everyday life. So you are now constantly improvising. Papers are blowing off my desk. How can I stop them from blowing off? So I need something to stop them from blowing away. What is other label what can act as a paper weight? A cup. Here is a cup. Let me put it on the paper. This is an example of improvisation where we use explanation-based learning to realize that this is how we use a flat bottom can act as a paper weight. Here is another example. I need to prop open a door, a door stopper is not available. What can I use? Perhaps an eraser or a chair. You and I do this kind of improvisation all the time, and often we are building these explanations that tell us that an eraser can be used as a door stopper.
