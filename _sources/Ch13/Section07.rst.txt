Now that we have learned to specify the initial state of the world and the ghosts of the world, let us do an exercise in specifying other states of the world. So please write down in this box, the state of the world that would occur after the robot is on the ladder and the ceiling has been painted.

        :feedback1: (".*", "Part of this state is that the ceiling is already painted, so you'll need a proposition to show that the ceiling has been painted. Part of this state is that the robot is on the ladder, so you'll need a proposition showing the robot is on the ladder in this state. This state is a conjunction -- the ceiling is painted and the robot is on the ladder -- so you'll need an 'and' in your state.")
