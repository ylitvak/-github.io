This introduces us to the need for parcel order planning. Parcel order planning occurs with the multiple goals. And the plan for achieving one goal provost another goal. David, can you think of an example of parcel order planning? So actually I do have a kind of funny example of parcel order planning. Not long ago, we bought a couch. And to keep things simple, we decided to pay them to assemble the couch for us. Then we got the couch home and found out that once the couch was already assembled, it would not fit through the apartment door. [LAUGH] So we had to completely disassemble the couch, move the pieces in one by one, and then reassemble the couch. So the plan for assembling the couch clobbered the goal of getting the couch into the apartment. Good example. Next we will discuss how partial order planning can help us detect conflicts like this and avoid them.
