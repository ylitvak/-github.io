David? So our initial state, is that each block is on top of the other. D is on B. B is on A. A is on C. And C is on the table. Our goal state, is each block on top of the other in a different order, an alphabetic order. So, A is on B. B is on C. And C is on the table. So our initial state is that the blocks are all stacked up, D is on B, B is on A, A is on C. C is on the table. And our goal state, is that the blocks are stacked up in alphabetical order, so A is on B, B is on C, C is on D and D is on table.
