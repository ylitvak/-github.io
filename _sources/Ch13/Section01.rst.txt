Today we'll talk about planning. Recall that we had said an intelligent agent maps perceptual histories into actions. Planning is a powerful method for action selection. We'll use the syntax we learned from logic last week to set up the specification of goals and states, and operators, for moving between states and achieving goals. We'll see that when there are multiple goals, there can be conflicts between them. We'll describe a specific technique called partial-order planning that avoids conflict between multiple goals. Finally, we'll talk about a representation called hierarchical task networks that allows us to make complex hierarchical plans.
