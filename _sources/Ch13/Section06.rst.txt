So, we just talked about goals and the goal state of the goals. In order to specify the goal fully, we need to not only specify the goal state, but also to specify the initial state. So, let's do that. Let us suppose that the initial state in this world is, that the robot is on the floor. Note, how I'm writing this. On is a predicate, that says this is a two [UNKNOWN] and I'm reading this as Robot On Floor. So Robot on Floor, and the Ladder is Dry, and the Ceiling is Dry. So, this is the Initial state, this is the Goal State. Now we have fully specified the goal. Let's now ask, how can the robot come up with a plan?
