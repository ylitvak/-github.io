That's good David. Note that when we did this problem previously using means analysis and product reduction, we ran in to all kinds of problems, because plans for property goals and we had no way of ordering these radius goals. Now we have a way, that's the power of partial [UNKNOWN]. Note also that this partial art of planning, this algorithm makes certain things that are implicit in human reasoning, explicit. Presumably when you and I reason about things we must be reasoning something like this, or at least this is one hypothesis about how we might be reasoning. And we have just made many of the operations of human reasoning so explicit and so precise.
