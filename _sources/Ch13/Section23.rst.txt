So like you said, our precondition for the first one, is that both x and y are clear. We can't move x if there's anything on top of x, and we can't put it on y if something is already on top of y. Our post condition then, is that x is on y. For the table it's a little bit easier, the table has unlimited room. So for the table, as long as X is clear we can move X to the table. And in the postcondition is that X is now on the table.
