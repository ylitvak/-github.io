So like you said [UNKNOWN], the plan of putting D on table's kind of trivial. And we actually see that it's the first step of any other plan. So we don't really need to articulate that explicitly. For putting A on B, our fastest idea would be to put D on the table, then to put B on the table, then to put A on top of B. I would just get a straight to putting A on B. For putting B on C, we need to put D on the table, B on the table, A on the table, and then move B on to the top of C. And then, for putting for C on D, we would need to move D to the table, B to the table, A to the table, and then put C on top of D.
