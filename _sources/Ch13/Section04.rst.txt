So in this box, please write down the second goal of painting the ladder in propositional form. And having done that, in this box, write down how would we represent the two goals as a conjunction.

.. fillintheblank:: Ch13_Q1

    .. blank:: blank11
        :correct: [P|p]ainted[(][L|l]adder[)]

        Represent the second part of the goal state: 

.. fillintheblank:: Ch13_Q1_2

        :correct: [P|p]ainted[(][C|c]eiling[)][^][P|p]ainted[(][L|l]adder[)]
