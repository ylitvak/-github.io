|Assignment Semantic Nets| 

The first assignment you can chose to do for this course is to talk
about how these semantic networks can be used to represent Raven’s
Progressive Matrices. We saw a few different problems in the first
lesson. So take a look at how the semantic networks we’ve talked about
today can be used to represent some of those other problems, and write
your own kind of representation scheme. In addition to writing a
representation scheme, also talk about how that representation scheme
actually enables problem solving. Remember what Ashok mentioned about
the different qualities of a good knowledge representation that is
complete. It captures information at the right level of abstraction, and
it enables problem solving. So write how your representation can enable
problem solving of two by one, two by two, and three by three problems.
You don’t need to use the exact same representation scheme that we use,
and in fact you can and should use your own. Also remember that your
representation should not capture any details about what the actual
answer to the problem is, but rather it should only capture what’s
actually in the figures in the particular problem.
