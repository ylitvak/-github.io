|Wrap Up| 

So let’s recap what we’ve talked about today. We started off today by
talking about one of the most important concepts in all of knowledge
based AI, which are knowledge based representations. As we go forward in
this class, we’ll see knowledge representations are really at the heart
of nearly everything we’ll do. We then talked about semantic networks,
which are a good particular kind of [knowledge] representation and we
used those to talk about the different criteria for a good knowledge
representation. What do good knowledge representations enable us to do
and what to they help us avoid? We then talked about kind of an abstract
class of problem solving methods called Represent and Reason. Represent
and reason really lies under all of knowledge based AI and it’s a way of
representing knowledge and then reasoning over it. We then talked a
little bit about augmenting that with weight, which allows us to come to
more nuanced and specific conclusions. In the next couple weeks, we are
going to use these semantic networks to talk about a few different
problem solving methods. Next time, we’ll talk about generating tests
and then we’ll move on to a couple slightly different ones called Means
and Analysis and Proper Reduction.
