How is semantic networks connected with human cognition? Well we can
make at least two connections immediately. First, semantic networks are
kind of knowledge representation. We saw hive knowledge is presented as
a semantic network. If the results of [power of] representation, then
you can use the knowledge presentation to address the problem. We can
now say similarly for human mind that human mind represents problems. It
represents knowledge. Then it uses that knowledge to address the
problem. So, representation then becomes the key. Second, and most
specifically, semantic networks are related to spreading activation
networks, which is a very popular theory of human memory. Let me give
you an example. Supposing I told you a story consisting of just two
sentences. John wanted to become rich. He got a gun. And notice that I
did not tell you the entire story, but Iâ€™m sure you all made up a story
based on what I told you. John wanted to become rich. He decided to rob
a bank. He got a gun in order to rob the bank. But how did you end this
story? How did it draw the inferences about robbing a bank which I did
not tell you anything about? Imagine if you have a semantic network that
consisted of a large number of nodes. So when I gave you the first
sentence, John wanted to become rich, the nodes corresponding to John
and wanted and become and rich, got activated, and the activation
started spreading from those nodes. And when I said John, he got a gun,
then the gun node also got activated and that activation also started
spreading. As this activation spread, it merged. And a path they could
walk on. And all the nodes on that pathway now become part of the story,
and if you happen to have nodes like, rob a bank along the pathway, now
you have understanding of story.
