|Discussion Good Representations 1| 

Let us think through this a little bit more deeply. Does the nutritional
label make all the information explicit, David? So it seems like it
does, for each given nutrient in the food, it lists the explicit amount
of that, that is present in the food. So it seems like it makes all the
information explicit. Would you say then, it enables me to draw the
right kind of inferences? Well, it certainly seems like it does. So, if
I’m worried about my diet and I’m worried about how many calories I’m
consuming, it tells me right there on the label exactly how many
calories it has. So, I can infer the right amount of food to eat per
day. If you’re concerned with something different in your diet, though,
it actually gives you the information to make a different kind of
inference. What about extraneous information, information that I may not
need? Well, that’s a good point, actually. Because it gives the
information that anyone might need and, as a result, it’s going to give
information that’s extraneous to somebody. So, for example, in my diet,
I might not care about the number of carbohydrates I consume. So, for
me, that’s extraneous information. But, for somebody else, that’s very
important. So it doesn’t avoid extraneous information, but it would be
really hard for it to do so. What about relationships? Does it make all
the concepts of all the relationships between them really explicit? So
actually, now that you mention it, Ashoke, it really doesn’t. So for
example, the number of calories from fat in a particular food is based,
in large part, on the amount of fat that’s in it. It gives the number of
calories from fat and the amount of fat in it right there on the label,
but it doesn’t tell me that there’s a relationship there. So I really
can’t make any inferences based on that relationship. I don’t even know
that relationship exists. So note how this connects with the ability to
make inferences. Nutritional labels capture some information that allows
us to make good inferences, do not capture all the information.
