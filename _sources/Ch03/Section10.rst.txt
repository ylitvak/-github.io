|Discussion Good Representations| 

So, what’s a good representation for everyday life? David, can you think
of an example? So a good example that comes to mind pretty quickly for
me is the example of the nutritional information on the side of a food
or beverage container. It lists slots for each different kind of
nutrient, and also lists the quantity that’s present in that food. So it
seems like it’s a pretty good representation of what’s actually going on
inside the food container. What do you think? Do you think David is
right?

.. mchoice:: representation
   :answer_a: Yes, because it lists all nutritional information explicitly.
   :answer_b: Yes, because it only provides the information relevant to the consumer.
   :answer_c: No, because it does not make explicit connections between linked variables like fat and fat calories.
   :answer_d: No, because it is not computable by a computer.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: It's true that it lists all the nutritional information explicitly, but that fact alone is not enough to make this a good representation. What else would it have to have to be a good representation?
   :feedback_b: Does nutritional information really only provide relevant information? It would seem that different consumers have different needs and interests, so it might not even be possible to provide a representation that is sufficient and relevant to every consumer.
   :feedback_c: That's the answer we have as well. There are relationships in the nutritional information that the panel on the side does not necessarily capture.
   :feedback_d: With automatic character recognition, even the visual label could be computed relatively easily, and from there the numeric values would be easy to store in a database.

   Is David right?
