David, did you solve this problem? So just like the original state,
there could be five moves that come out of this. Two of the moves we can
already say are illegal. Moving two guards would have more prisoners
than guards on the left. And moving one guard and one prisoner would end
up with too many prisoners on the right. So we don’t include those
states. Then our three legal moves are to move one prisoner, two
prisoners, or one guard. But, now I notice that this state is actually
identical to this state. Like we said before, once we’re in a state, we
don’t really care how we got there. So going back to an earlier state is
not a productive move. So, we can rule this out as an unproductive move.
Similarly, this state is the same as this state. So we can rule this out
as an unproductive move as well. That leaves us with only one legal
productive move that can follow from the previous state. That is a very
good point, David. So this representation is a good representation for
this problem, because it is making all the constraints of the problem
solving explicit. So that we can quickly compare states and say, which
moves are productive and moves are not productive? I can tell you that
when I tried to solve this problem on my own, it took me a while because
I didn’t recognize the fact that I kept going around in a circle because
I didn’t realize I kept coming back to the exact same state. In fact,
David, most of us have the same difficulty. So the power of this
semantic network as a representation is arising because it allows us to
systematically solve this problem, because it makes all the constraints,
all the objects, all the relationships, all the moves, very explicit.
