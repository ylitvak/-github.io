|Exercise Represent Reason for Ravens 1| 

What answer did you come up with, David? Is two the correct answer? So I
said that that was the correct answer. It looks to me like the
relationships at play in frame A and frame C are the same. And the
relationships at play in frame B and frame 2 are the same. We saw that x
was unchanged between the two frames, just as r is. Y expanded, just s
does. And z was deleted, just as t is. Similarly, y was above x, just as
s is above r. So I think it’s the right answer. Good David, that’s in
fact the correct answer. Two is the best choice of a level here. But
imagine that for 2 s row, the match between the representation on the
left side and the representation on the right side was only partial.
Just like it was when we had five over here. How then would we make a
choice between two and five, David? So it sounds like so far we’ve been
talking about an all-or-nothing match of transformations. But if we
didn’t have an exact match between the transformations, we’d have to
come up with some way to evaluate how well two transformations actually
fit together. So we might say that these transformations are 95
