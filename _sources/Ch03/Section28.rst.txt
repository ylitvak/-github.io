What is everyone think? Is 2 the right answer here? Well, lets look at
the choices. First note, that both 2 and 4 are legitimate answers. 2 is
legitimate because we can think of the transformation from A to B as a
reflection around the vertical axis. And so if we think of the
transformation from C to D, again as a reflection of the vertical axis,
we’ll get 2. 4 is also a correct answer, because we can think of the
transformation from A to B as a rotation of 180 degrees, and if we
rotate C by 180 degrees we’ll get 4. However, if we look at our weights
again, we gave reflection a higher weight than we gave rotation. And
therefore, David is right, 2 indeed is the correct answer.
