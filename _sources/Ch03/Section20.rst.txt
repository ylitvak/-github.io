|Exercise Guards and Prisoners III 1| 


How many moves did you come up with, David? So, I was able to do the
problem in 11 moves. I won’t talk you through the entire process, but if
you’d like to pause this video you can take a look and see the exact
moves I used, and see if they match yours. We know that 11 moves are the
most efficient way to solve the problem, but these aren’t the only 11
moves that can actually solve the problem. Good, David. That’s the
correct answer. So now that we have solved this problem together, next
time you go to a cocktail party, you can entertain all of your guests by
showing how you can do this problem so effectively and so efficiently.
Even if all of them flounder trying to do things on their napkin that’s
not succeeding. So we’ve not yet talked about how an AI method can
determine which states are productive and which states are unproductive.
We’ll revisit this issue in the next couple lessons.
