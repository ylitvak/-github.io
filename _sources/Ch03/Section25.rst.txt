|Exercise How do we choose a match 1| 

What answer did you think about, David? So this is a tiny bit different
than the one we saw earlier. Earlier, we saw this exercise without the
square as an option, so we were forced to pick the triangle. But here,
since we actually have the square as the option, I think the easier
transformation is to say that the middle shape is disappearing. Thus,
the triangle disappears and leaves us with just that square. So, I’d say
that five is the correct answer. That’s a good answer, David, but note
that three could also be an answer because one could imagine the
relationship between A and B a little differently. Suppose we were to
say that the outer circle is disappearing and the inner circle is
expanding. In that case, we will again get B. So in that case, we might
say that the outer image is disappearing, this square, and the inner
shape is expanding to give us three. So three is also a legitimate
answer. So I imagine though, that most people would choose answer five
over answer three. But why would most of us choose answer five over
answer three? That’s a great question. Let’s look at this in more
detail.
