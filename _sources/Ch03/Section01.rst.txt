   *I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They
   sell themselves short without trying. One bit of advice: It is important
   to view knowledge as a sort of a semantic tree – make sure you
   understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches,
   before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to
   hang on to.*

Okay. Let’s get started with Knowledge PCI. Today we’ll talk about
semantic networks. This is the kind of knowledge representation scheme.
This is the first lesson in our fundamental topics part of the course.
We’ll start talking about knowledge representations, then we’ll focus on
semantic networks. We’ll illustrate how semantic networks can be used to
address two by one matrix problems. You can think of this like a
represent and reason modality. Represent the knowledge, represent the
problem, then use that knowledge to address the problem. As simple as
that. At the end, we’ll close this lesson by connecting this topic with
human cognition and with modern research in AI.
