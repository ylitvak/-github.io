So what answers did you come up with, David? So we knew that because the
boat is traveling from the right back to the left, that the boat is
going to be on the left in each of the next states, so we didn’t even
ask for that. In the top state, the only things we could do are move
both people back, just the guard back, or just the prisoner back. Moving
both back would just take us back to our original state, so while it’s
legal, it’s not productive. Moving just our prisoner back would have
more prisoners on the left than guards, so that wouldn’t be a legal
move. So our only move is to move our guard back to the left. Similarly
on the bottom, we could either move both prisoners back to the left, or
just one. Moving both would take us back to our original state which
isn’t productive. Moving just one, then, is our only legal next state.
That was a good answer, David. Thank you. Note David, that these two
states that he came up with, the one at the top here and one at the
bottom here, are in fact identical. And because they’re identical,
therefore we can collapse them into one state. So, now we get the
representation shown in this figure, the two states have been collapsed
into one. So in this semantic network, we don’t really care how we got
into a state, just as long as we know what state we’re in. And that
makes sense in this problem solving process. Once we’re in this state,
we don’t care if we got to it this way, or this way, all we care about
is the current state of the problem.
