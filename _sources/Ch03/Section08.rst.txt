|Structure of Semantic Networks| 


Now that we have seen some examples of semantic networks, let us try to
characterize semantic networks as a knowledgeable presentation. A
knowledgeable presentation, will have a lexicon. That tells us something
about the vocabulary of the presentation language. A structure which
tells us about how the words of that vocabulary can be composed together
into complex representations and the semantics which tells us how the
representation allows us to draw inferences so that we can in fact
reason. In case of semantic network the basic lexicon consists of nodes
that capture objects. So, x, y, z. What about this structural
specification? Structural specification here consists of links which
have directions. These links capture relationships and allows to compose
these notes together into complex representations. What about the
semantics? In case of semantics, we are going to put labels on these
links which are then going to allow us to do, draw inferences and do
reasoning over these representations.
