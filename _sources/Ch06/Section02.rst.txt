|Exercise A Pitcher| 
|Exercise A Pitcher 1| 
To illustrate production systems, let us imagine that you are a baseball
pitcher. This illustration is coming from a game between Atlanta Braves
and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Here is a pitcher on the mound, and a
pitcher has to decide, whether to pitch a ball to the batter, or whether
to walk the batter. To be more specific, take a look at the story here
in the left. Read it. And to decide what would the pitcher do. What
would you do? What would an intelligent agent do? If you don’t know much
about baseball, don’t worry about it. Part of the goal here is to see
what someone who does not know about, a lot about baseball may do.
