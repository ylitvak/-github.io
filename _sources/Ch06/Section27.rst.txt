|The Cognitive Connection 1| 
|The Cognitive Connection 2| 
The connection between production systems and human cognition is both
powerful and straightforward. In fact, production systems, right from
the beginning were proposed as models of human cognition. We can look at
it from several perspectives. First, the working memory in production
system has a counterpart in human cognition in the form of short-term
memory. Short-term memory and human cognition, at least for the verbal
part, has a capacity for approximately seven plus or minus two elements.
Working memory and production systems plays a similar role. Second,
people have connected studies which they have given the same problems,
both to humans and to cognitive architectures [affordances]. These
problems typically are from closed worlds like arithmetic or algebra. At
a consult, there are strong similarities between the behavior of
programs like SOAR and the behavior of humans when they address problems
in arithmetic and algebra. This, however, does not mean that we already
have a very good complete model of human cognition. This is just the
beginning. Humans engage in a very large number of problems, not just
arithmetic or algebra problems in closed worlds. So there still remain a
large number of questions open about how do you build a cognitive
architecture that can capture human cognition at large in the open?
