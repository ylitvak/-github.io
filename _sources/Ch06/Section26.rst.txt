|Wrap Up| 
So let’s wrap up our discussion for today and also wrap up the
foundational unit of our course as a whole. We started off today by
revisiting this notion of Cognitive architectures that we talked about
at the very beginning of the course. We use that to contextual our
discussion of Production systems, specifically those implemented in a
framework called SOAR. As we saw, production systems enable action
selection. They help us map percepts in the world into actions. Of
course, this is only one of the many things that a production system can
do. It can really map any kind of antecedent into any kind of
consequent. But in our example, we saw how the production system for a
pitcher can map percepts from a baseball game into pitch selection. We
then talked about impasses and how when a production system hits an
impasse, it can use chunking to learn a new rule to overcome that
impasse. This is the first time we’ve encountered learning in our
course, but learning is actually going to be foundational to everything
we talk about from here on. This wraps up the fundamentals unit of our
course. Next time we’re going to talk about frames, which we actually
saw a little bit of today. Frames are going to become a knowledge
representation that we’ll use throughout the rest of our course.
