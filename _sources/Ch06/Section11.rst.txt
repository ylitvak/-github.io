Let us now go back to example of the baseball pitcher who has to decide
on a action to take in a particular circumstance. So we can think of
this pitcher as mapping a percept history into an action. Now imagine
that this pitcher is embodying a production system. We are back to a
very specific situation, and you can certainly read it again. Recall
that David had given the answer, the pitcher will intentionally walk the
batter. So we want to make the theory of how might the pitcher or
internal and AI agent come to this decision. Recall the very specific
situation that the pitcher is facing. And recall also that David had
come up with this answer. So, here is a set of percepts, and here is an
action. And the question is, how these percepts get mapped into this
action? We are going to add one build a theory of how the human pitcher
might be making these decisions, as well as a theory of how an AI agent
could be built to make this decision. So letâ€™s go back to the example of
the pitcher having to decide on a action in a particular situation in
the world. So the pitcher has several kinds of knowledge. Some of its
knowledge is internal. It already has it. Some of it, it can perceive
from the world around it. As an example, the pitcher can perceive the
various objects here, such as the bases, first, second, third base. The
pitcher can perceive the batter here. The pitcher can perceive the
current state of the game. The specific score in the inning, the
specific batter. The pitcher can perceive the positions of its own
teammates. So, all these things the pitcher can perceive, and these then
are become exact specific kinds of knowledge that each pitcher has. The
pitcher also has internal knowledge. The pitcher has knowledge about his
goals and objectives here.
