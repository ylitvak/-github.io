|Exercise Production System in Action I 1| 
That was right, David. So note what happened. There were the contents of
the working memory. Here were all the rules of a level in the procedural
part of the long-term memory. And so then, match the contents of the
working memory with the antecedents of the various productions.
Depending on the match between the contents of the working memory, and
the antecedents of the rules, some rules got activated, fired as some
people say. Depending upon what rule got fired, that resulted in,
perhaps, firing of additional rules. So as David said, if the rule
number one got activated because the goal became intentionally walk the
batter, that then lead to the activation of rule number three, which was
to select the intentional-walk operator. In this way, given the set of
contents of the working memory and a mapping between those contents and
the antecedents of the various production rules that capture the
procedure knowledge. Some rules get activated, and this activation
continues until sort cannot activate any additional rules. At that
point, sort has given an answer, based on the consequence of a rule that
matches a motor action. Note that sort just provided an account of how
the picture decided on a specific page, on a specific action. Note that,
weâ€™re started with the goal of providing an account of how the pitcher
selects on an action or how an AI agent selects on an action. So what is
the account? Based on the goal and the percents, match them with the
antecedence of the rules that captured the procedural knowledge. And
then, accept the consequent of some production that matches some motor
action from some precepts we have gone to some action.
