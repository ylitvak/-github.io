|Action Selection| 
|Action Selection 1| 
So imagine that Kris Medlen from Atlanta Braves is the pitcher. And
Martin Prado from Arizona Diamondbacks is at the bat. Kris Medlen has
the goal of finishing the inning without allowing any runs. How does
Kris Medlen decide on an action? We may conceptualize Medlen’s decision
making like the following. Medlen may look at various choices that are
available to him. He may throw a pitch. Or he may choose to walk the
batter. If he walks the batter, then there are additional possibilities
that open up. He’ll need to face the next batter. If he chooses to
pitch, then he’ll have to decide what kind of ball to throw. A slider, a
fast ball, or a curve ball. If it was a slider, then there is a next set
of possibilities open up. There might be a strike or a ball or a hit or
he may just strike the batter out. Thus, Medlen is setting up a state
space. Now, what we just did informally can be stated formally. So, we
can imagine a number of states in the states space. The state space is a
combination of all the states that can be achieved by applying various
combinations of operators, starting from the initial state. Each state
can be described in terms of some features, f1, f2, there could be more.
Each feature can take on some values. For example, v1, there might be a
range of values here. So initially, the picture is at state s0. And the
pitcher wants to assume some state S101. And at a state S101 presumably
the pitcher the pitcher’s goal has been accomplished. So we may think as
the pitcher’s decision making as some kind of a part of its current
state to this particular goal state. This is an abstract space. The
pitcher has not yet made any action. The picture is still thinking. The
picture is sitting up an abstract state space in his mind and exploding
that state space.
