|Architecture Content Behavior| 
|Architecture Content Behavior 1| 
We can capture the basic intuition behind work on cognitive
architectures by a simple equation, architecture plus content equals
behavior. Let us look at this equation from two different perspectives.
First, imagine that you want to design an intelligent machine that
exhibits a particular kind of behavior. This equation says that, in
order to do that, you have to design the right architecture, and then
put the right kind of knowledge content into that architecture, to get
the behavior that you want from it. That’s a complicated thing. But
suppose that I could fix the architecture for you. In that case, if the
architecture is fixed, I simply have to change the knowledge content to
get different behaviors, which is a really powerful idea. From a
different direction, suppose that we were trying to understand human
behavior. Now we could say, again, that the architecture is fixed, we
could say that, this behavior is arising because the knowledge content
is different. We can map now, behavior to content because the
architecture is fixed. That simplifies our understanding of how to
design machines or how to understand human cognition. By the way, the
same thing happens in computer architecture. I’m sure you have, are
familiar with computer architecture. Computer architecture has stored
programs in it, that’s the content, and that running of the stored
program gives you different behaviors. The computer architecture doesn’t
change, the stored program keeps on changing, to give you different kind
of behaviors. Same idea with cognitive architectures. Keep the
architecture constant, change the content. Now, of course, the big
question will become, what is a good architecture? And that’s what we’ll
examine later.
