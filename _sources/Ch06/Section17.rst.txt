|Exercise Production System in Action II| 
Now let us consider another situation. Suppose that our pitcher actually
was able to walk the batter. So, now, there are runners on the first,
second, ands third bases. Not just on the second and third bases, but
one on the first, also. So the picture succeeded in accomplishing itâ€™s
goal in the last shot. So the current situation then is discard, but
this side of percept and this goal. The confidence of the working memory
have just changed. Of course, the production rules capturing the pursuit
of knowledge have not yet changed. So these are exactly the same
productions that we had previously. Only the contents of the working
memory has changed. We now have a runner at the first as well as the
second and the third. And this exercise is very intrusting because it
will lead us to a different set of conclusions. Given the set of
precepts in this goal and the set of production rules, what operator do
you think the picture will select?
