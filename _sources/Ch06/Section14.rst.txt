|Bringing in Memory 1| 
So, source working memory not contains all the things that we had in the
previous shot. Some of these are percepts. Some the things are the
pitcher’s internal goals. Let us see how the contents of the working
memory, now invoke different kinds of knowledge from the long term
memory. So, let us imagine that the procedural part of source long term
memory contains the following rules. The procedural knowledge and source
long term memory is represented in the form of rules. The system
sometimes called production group. In fact, the term production systems
comes from the term production group. So, each rule here is a production
group. I’ve shown seven here, there could be more rules. Once again,
these production rules are captured in the procedural knowledge, and
soource long-term memory. Recall that one of the first things that the
pitcher had to decide was whether the pitcher should throw a pitch or
walk the batter. Therefore, we assume that there are some rules which
allow the pitcher to make a decision between these two choices. Thus
there is a rule here. If the goal is to escape, and I perceive two outs,
and I perceive on the second, and I perceive a runner on the second and
I perceive no runner on the first base, then I’m suggest a goal of
intentionally walk batter. There is another rule. The second rule says,
if the goal is to escape, and I perceive two outs and I perceive a
runner on the first base. Or if perceived not out on the second, or if
perceived no runners, then suggest the goal to get the batter out via
pitching. And what might happen if I pick the goal of intentionally
walking the batter? The goal is to intentionally walk the batter then
suggest intentional walk operator. Now, this intentional walk operator
corresponds to some action available to all. And similarly, the other
rules. Let’s consider one other rule, rule number seven. If only one
operator has been selected, then send the operator to the motor system
and add the pitch thrown to the state. So, there is both now an action
has been selected, and the action is going to be executed. As well as
the state of the working memory is going to be changed, so it will say
that now the pitch has been thrown. Before we go ahead, let me summarize
what we just learned. Source long term memory consists of various kinds
of knowledge. One kind of knowledge, the one that we are considering
right now is procedural knowledge. Procedural knowledge is about how to
do something. And so procedural knowledge is represented in the form of
production rules. Each production rule is, is of the form, if something
then something. There are antecedents and their consequence. These
antecedents may be connected through various kind of relationships, like
and, and or. The consequence too might be connected through various kind
of relationships like and, and or. So I may have if some antecedent is
true, and some other, other ante, antecedent is true, and so on, then do
some consequent. Now that we understand a little bit about the
representation of production rules. What about the content? What should
be the content that we put into these production rules? Earlier we had
said that cognitive architectures are goal oriented. So we’ll expect
goals to appear in some of the production rules. Indeed, they do. R1,
r2, r3, and so on. Earlier we had said that knowledge based AI cognitive
systems, use a lot of knowledge. And you can see how detailed and
specific this knowledge is. In fact, the knowledge is so detailed and
specific that in principle we can hope that as different percepts come
from the world, some rule is available that will be useful for that set
of percepts.
