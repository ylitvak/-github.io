This is the first time we have come across the topic of learning in this
course, so let us examine it a little bit more closely. We are all
interested in asking the question, how do agents learn? But this
question is not isolated from a series of other questions. What do
agents learn? What is the source of their learning? When do they learn?
And why do they learn at all? For the purpose of addressing what goal or
what task? Now here is the fundamental stance that knowledge based AI
takes. It says that we’ll start with a theory of reasoning. That will
help us address questions like, what to learn, when to learn, why to do
learning? And only then will we go to the question, of how to do the
learning. So, we reasoning first, and then backwards to learning. This
happened in production systems. When the production system reach an
impasse, then it said let’s learn in order to resolve this impasse from
episodic knowledge. So once again, we are trying to build a unified
theory of reasoning, memory, and learning where the demands of memory
and reasoning constrain the processing of learning.
