|Exercise Levels of Architectures 1| 
Derrick what do you think about this? So what we talked about before was
that the bottom layer is the hardware layer. I’m not completely sure
what the hardware of Watson looks like but I assume there has to be a
physical computer there somewhere. At the next layer, the algorithm
layer, Watson has some general searching and decision-making ability
that allows him to search over his knowledge base and come to decisions.
These are general abilities that are separated from whatever individual
thing he’s trying to think about right now. And then at the top layer we
can think about exactly that, what he’s trying to think about right now.
So the task here might be answering the inputted clue. This would
involve searching on the individual information in the clue, processing
his knowledge specifically about that data, and then coming to an answer
specifically for that clue. That was a good answer David. So the again
the three layers and note that in the task layer here, answering the
inputted clue, knowledge is also a part of it. Knowledge that Watson
must have in order to be able to answer that particular question, how
that knowledge is implemented, what kind of presentations it uses goes
in the second layer.
