|Assignment Production Systems| 
So how would you use a production system to design an agent that can
solve Raven’s Progressive Matrices. We could think about this kind of at
two different levels. At one level we could imagine a production system
that’s able to address any incoming problem. It has a set of rules for
what to look for in a new problem and it knows how to reply when it
finds those things. But on the other hand, we can also imagine
production rules that are specific to a given problem. When the agent
receives a new problem, it induces some production rules that govern the
transformation between certain figures and then transfers that to other
rows and columns. So in that way, it’s able to use that same kind of
production system methodology to answer these problems, even though it
doesn’t come into the problem with any production rules written in
advance. So, inherent in this idea though, is the idea of learning from
the problem that it receives. How is this learning going to take place?
How is it actually going to write these production rules, based on a new
problem? And what’s the benefit of doing it this way? What do we get out
of actually having these production rules, that are written based on
individual problems?
