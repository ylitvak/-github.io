|Exercise System in Action III 1| 
What do you think, David? So just like last time we’ll set that the goal
is to get the batter out via pitching. And we’ll add the necessary
information to our current working memory, but when we get down here
something confusing happens. So we suggest the throw-curve-ball operator
because our goal is to pitch and the batter isn’t out. But then, we also
suggest they throw a fast ball operator because the goal is to pitch,
the batter’s not out and the batter bats left-handed. So, when we get
down to rule seven, which is if only one operator has been selected, it
doesn’t fire. So our current rules don’t actually lead anywhere. We
never bottom out. We never figure out what we want to do. Good David.
That was the correct answer. So note what has happened? So far we had
assumed that the match between the percept and the production rules
captioning the personal knowledge was such that, given the percept we
always have one rule which will tell us what action to take. It may take
some time to get to this rule. Some rules may need to be established.
And then only so the rules get established, then only we get the action.
But never the less, the system would work. The difficulty now is, there
is no rule which tells us exactly what action to take.
