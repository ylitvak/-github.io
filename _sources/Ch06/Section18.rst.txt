|Exercise Production System in Action II 1| 
David, what do you think the patient would select next? So unlike last
time, the first production rule won’t fire because I do perceive a
runner on first. Instead, while I don’t perceive fewer than two outs, I
do perceive a runner on first. So this production rule will fire, and
now by goal is to get the batter out via pitching. That’ll skip the next
rule and come down to here. Given that the goal is to pitch and we have
a new batter, we’re going to add some information to our stake. So we
can actually now, not just keep track of the game as a whole, but we can
keep track of this individual exchange with the batter. Then the goal is
to pitch and the batter is not yet out, so we’re going to suggest the
throw-curve-ball-operator. We then look and see that the batter bats
right handed so the next rule doesn’t fire. So at this point, we’ve only
suggest one operator, the throw-curve-ball-operator. So we’re going to
send that to our motor system. So the answer will be that we’ll throw a
curve ball. That was right, David, thank you. Let’s summarize some of
the things that David noted. So, based on the contents of the working
memory, some rules get activated. As these rules get activated, some
consequence get established. As this consequence get established, they
get written. Those consequence get written on the working memory. So the
contents of working memory are constantly changing. As the contents of
the working memory change, nodules can get activated. So there is a
constant interaction between the working memory and the long term
memory. The contents of the working memory change quite rapidly. The
contents of the long term memory change very, very slowly.
