So we have come across this high level architecture for deliberation
earlier. Today we will talk about a specific cognitive architecture for
deliberation. This architecture is called SOAR. I should mention that
SOAR not only covers deliberation, SOAR can also cover certain aspects
of reaction, and some aspects of meta cognition. But we are going to
focus mostly on the deliberation component and so on. SOAR was initiated
by Allen Neville, John Lear, and Paul Rosenbloom. And John Lear and Paul
Rosenbloom have been working on it for the last 30 years or so. The
highest level consists of a long term memory and a working memory. The
[David] itself contains different kinds of knowledge. In particular SOAR
talks about three kinds of knowledge. Procedural, semantic, and
episodic. Episodic knowledge has to do with events. Specific instances
of events, like, what did you have for dinner yesterday. Semantic
knowledge has to do with generalizations in the form of concepts and
models of the world. For example, your concept of a human being, or your
model of how a plane flies in the air. Procedural has to do with how to
do certain things. So as an example, how do you pour water from a jug
into a tumbler. Notice that this makes an architecture. There are
different components that are interacting with each other. This
arrangement of components will afford certain processes of reasoning and
learning. That’s exactly the kind of processes of reasoning and learning
that we’ll look at next.
