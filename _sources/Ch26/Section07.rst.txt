Our fourth principle was a Knowledge Based AI agents match methods to tasks. At the beginning of this course we covered several very powerful problem solving methods like Generate & Test, and Means-Ends Analysis. But because they were very powerful and very general, they also weren't necessarily the best for solving any one problem. We also covered some more specific problem solving methods like planning that addressed a narrower set of problems but addressed those problems very, very well. We also covered several tasks in this class, like configuration and diagnosis and design. These tasks could all be carried out by a variety of methods. For example, we can imagine doing configuration with Generate & Test or we generate every possible configuration of a certain plan and then test to see which one is best. We could also do configuration by Problem Reduction where we reduce the problem down into the sub parts and solve them individually and then compose them into an overall solution. In this way, knowledge based AI agents match methods to tasks. In some cases we do the matching, we decide that generate and test is the best way to address this diagnosis problem. In other cases we might design AI agents with their own meta-reasoning such that they themselves can decide which method is best for the task that they're facing right now. Note that this distinction between methods and tasks is not always necessarily absolute. Methods can spawn different sub tasks, so for example, if we're doing design by case-based reasoning that spawns new problems to address. And we might address those new problems, those new tasks, with analogical reasoning, or with problem reduction. This gets back to our meta-reasoning notion of strategy integration. In this way, knowledge based AI agents match methods to tasks not only at the top level, but also at every level of the task-subtask hierarchy.
