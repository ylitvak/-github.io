This brings us to the end of the course. There are many more topics that we could talk about, and we encourage you to look at the additional readings for the course. As we said at the beginning, we have had a lot of fun putting this course together, and we have learned a lot, too. We hope you have enjoyed the course as well. We're also really eager to get your feedback. What did you enjoy about this course? And what could have been improved? What surprised you about this course, either in the content or in the way that it was administered? Are there things that you've seen other courses do that you wish we'd done, or are things that we did that you'd like to see other courses do? We are very interested in your answers to these questions, so please feel free to contact either one of us with your answers, and fill out the course survey as well. We'd also like to thank several people for helping make this course possible. First, our video editor, Aaron, who's done a phenomenal job making these videos look so good and frankly making us look presentable. We'd also like to thank the rest of you at Assety, especially Jenny Kim, Jason Barrows, and Katie Reicult for providing a great infrastructure for course development. We'd also like thank our colleagues here at Georgia Tech, including David White at the college of computing. And Mark Weston and his staff at the Georgia Professional Education Department. It's been a real fun journey for us. We expect to hear from you. We hope it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
