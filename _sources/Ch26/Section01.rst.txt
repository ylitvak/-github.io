*The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up... His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way.
-- Nikola Tesla*

Today we'll wrap up this course. It's been a fun journey. But like all journeys, this one too must come to an end. The goal for today's lesson is to tie together some of the big things we have been discussing, and to point to some of the other big ideas out there in the community. We'll start by revisiting the high level structure of the course. Then we'll go through some of recurrent patterns and principles we've encountered throughout the course. Finally, we'll talk about all the broader impacts and applications of knowledge based AI.
