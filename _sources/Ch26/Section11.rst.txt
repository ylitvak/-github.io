Knowledge based is a dominate field with a very active research program. There are number of exiting projects going on right now. Here is a small list of them. CALO is a project, in which cognitive assistant learns and organizes knowledge. CALO, in fact was a pick cursor for the CD program of Apple. Cyc and OMCS. OMCS stands for Open Mind Common Sense. Cyc and OMCS are two large knowledge bases to support everyday common sense of reasoning. Wolfram Alpha is a new kind of search engine that uses some of the same kind of pilot structures we have considered in this particular class, different from many of the search engines. The three projects in the right column are projects here at Georgia Tech. VITA is a computational model of visual thinking in autism. And particular it solves problems in the real world raven's progressive matrices test using only visual spacial representations. Dramatis is a computational model suspense in drama and stories. Recall that in this class we talked about the theory of humor and surprise. Dramatis tries to do the same thing for suspense. DANE is a system for supporting design based on analogies to natural systems. We've come across this idea of biologically inspired design earlier in the class and DANE supports that kind of biologically inspired design. We have provided references for these and many other knowledge based AI projects in the class notes. Your welcome to explore depending on your inquests.
