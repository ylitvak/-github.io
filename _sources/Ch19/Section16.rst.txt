What did you write down, David? So, in this case, the only difference between this and the previous positive example is that now it's lunch instead of breakfast. So, the only thing we're going to generalize here is that now it can be any meal instead of just being breakfast, but we're still going to say that it has to be Kim's on Friday. It has to be cheap, and it can't be vegan. And note that they could have put here breakfast or lunch, but for simplicity has generalized it to any meal.
