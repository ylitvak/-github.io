So I said that there'll be three potential general models left after specializing and pruning. Those three models are going to be that I could just be allergic to everything at Kim's, I could just always be allergic to breakfast, or I could just be allergic to eating on Friday. I would prune the ones based on cost and whether or not the meal is vegan, because although I've had bad reactions to cheap, non-vegan meals in the past, here I didn't have a reaction to a cheap, non-vegan meal. So it's not sufficient to say I'm allergic to everything non-vegan or I'm allergic to all cheap food.
