So, this example is pretty similar to the case we had in the previous example. So, the most specific case is that I'm simply allergic to any breakfast that comes on Friday that's cheap and isn't vegan, so this very specific example. And the most general model is I'm just allergic to everything, no matter what meal it is, what day it is, how much it costs, whether it's vegan, or what restaurant I got it at.
