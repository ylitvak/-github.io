Note that in this exercise, there were only seven examples and only five features. So we could do it by hand. What would happen if the number of examples was much larger and the number of features were much larger? This algorithm would still work but we'll need a lot more computing power. It is also possible that the algorithm may not be able find the right concept to converge to because I might be allergic to multiple meals at multiple restaurants such as breakfast at Kim's and lunch at Sam's. But even in that case, the benefit of this algorithm is it will show that convergence is not possible even after many, many examples.
