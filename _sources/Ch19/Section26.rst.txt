So today we've talked about version spaces. Version spaces are an algorithm for converging onto an understanding of a concept, even in the absence of prior background knowledge or an intelligent teacher. We covered the algorithm for version spaces, where we iteratively refine a general and specific model of a concept, until they converge down onto one another. We then talked about using version spaces to address more complex problems. We've also connected version spaces to older concepts, like incremental concept learning. Finally we talked about the limitations of version spaces, such as what to do if there's no single correct concept, or what to do in the absence of either positive or negative examples. To address these, we also covered identification trees, which are a different ways of approaching the same kind of data that version spaces operate on. We'll touch on version spaces and incremental concept learning again, when we talk about mistake based learning.
