David, what do you think? Where should the agent put, Handle is Fixed, in this explanation? So it seems like the most obvious place to put it would be under the Object is Liftable connection. In order to make it liftable to enable drinking, it needs to be fixed. What do you think, is this a good way to fix the agent's error?
