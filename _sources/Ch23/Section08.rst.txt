You may recall this explanation from our lesson on explanation-based learning. There, the agent constructed an explanation like this to show that a specific object was an example of a cup. For a good example of a pail, the agent may have constructed similar explanation with the object being replaced by pail everywhere. Now however, the agent knows that pail is not an example of a cup. Something is not quite right with this explanation. We've also just seen how the agent can identify the false suspicious relationship in this explanation. It is identified, but the handle must be fixed because that is the feature that separates the positive experiences from the negative experiences. The question then becomes, how can this explanation be repaired by incorporating handle as fixed? Where should handle as fixed go?
